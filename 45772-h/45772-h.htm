<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>A preface should be personal. An author who
writes on such subjects as Old Furniture and Old
China, with a view to educating public taste and
attempting to show why certain objects should be
regarded more lovingly than others, meets with
a volume of correspondence from collectors.
Threaded through such correspondence, extended
over a long period, I find the constant demand for
a volume dealing with old clocks in a popular
manner.</p>

<p>There is no house without its clock or clocks, and
few collectors of old furniture have excluded clocks
from their hobby. I have been therefore blamed
that I did not include some more detailed treatment
of clocks in my volumes on "Old Furniture" and
"Cottage and Farmhouse Furniture," my readers
very justly advancing the argument that clocks
form part of the study of domestic furniture as a
whole.</p>

<p>This may be admitted. But in the endeavour to
satisfy such a want on the part of my clients, I plead
that the subject of clockmaking is one to which
years of study must be devoted.</p>

<p>Since the first appearance of my <i>Chats on Old</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<i>Furniture</i> in 1905, I have not been unmindful of the
co-related subject of old clocks. Over ten years
of study, running parallel with my other work on
the evolution of ornament and decoration of the
English home, has enabled me to gather a mass of
material and to attempt to satisfy the request for
a complementary volume to my <i>Chats on Old
Furniture</i> and <i>Chats on Cottage and Farmhouse
Furniture</i>.</p>

<p>To this end I have embodied in this present
volume many facts relating to provincial styles as
well as Scottish and Irish types, with lists of local
makers not before published.</p>

<p>To the critics to whom I have hitherto been indebted
for realizing the niche I desire to fill with my
volumes, I preface this volume by stating that as far
as possible the technicalities of clockmaking have
been eliminated. The average reader and the average
collector would be bored by such details, although
some of us might like to see them included. I have
not referred to foreign clockmaking, nor to famous
church and turret clocks, nor to marvels of horology;
I have advisedly limited my field to the English
domestic clock. That such a treatment would appeal
more to the collector is my personal opinion, and I
trust my critics may incline to my view.</p>

<p>The illustrations in the volume have been chosen
to illustrate the letterpress and to illuminate points I
endeavour to make in regard to the evolution of the
various types coming under my observation.</p>

<p>I have to express my indebtedness to the authorities
of the British Museum for permission to include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
illustrations of examples in that collection, and I
am similarly indebted to the authorities of the
National Museum, Dublin.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of the Corporation of Nottingham
I am reproducing a clock in their collection, and
similarly by the courtesy of the Bristol Corporation
I am including an example in their possession. The
Corporation of Glasgow have afforded me permission
to include a remarkable example of Scottish work,
and the authorities of the Metropolitan Museum,
New York, have accorded me a similar privilege in
illustrating specimens in their collection.</p>

<p>Among those who have generously augmented my
researches and come to my aid in regard to local
makers, I desire to express my obligation to
George H. Hewitt, Esq., J.P., of Liverpool, who
arranged the clocks in the exhibit at the Liverpool
Tercentenary Exhibition in 1907, and to E. Rimbault
Dibdin, Esq., of the Walker Art Gallery,
Liverpool. To Basil Anderton, Esq., of the Public
Libraries, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and to T. Leo Reid,
Esq., of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, I am especially grateful
for solid help in regard to North Country makers.
To H. Tapley-Soper, Esq., City Librarian, Exeter,
I am indebted for names of West-Country makers,
and to A. Bromley Sanders, Esq., of Exeter, I am
obliged for information relating to local clocks coming
under his purview for many years. James Davies,
Esq., of Chester, and S. H. Hamer, Esq., of Halifax,
have enlarged my horizon in regard to local makers.
H. Wingent, Esq., of Rochester, an enthusiastic
collector and connoisseur of old clocks, has kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
enabled me to reproduce one of his examples. To
Herbert Bolton, Esq., of the Bristol Museum and
Art Gallery, I am indebted for the inclusion of a
fine specimen in that collection.</p>

<p>I desire especially to record the generous aid I
have had from Percy Webster, Esq., of Great Portland
Street, London, who is well known as a connoisseur
of old clocks, and from his son, Malcolm R. Webster,
Esq., who have given me practical assistance in
regard to verifying facts from actual examples.</p>

<p>To Thomas Rennie, Esq., of the Glasgow Art
Galleries and Museums, I desire to record thanks.
To Edward Campbell, Esq., of Glasgow, who has
enriched my volume with examples of Scottish
work in his collection, I am indebted for information
regarding Scottish makers embodied in this volume.</p>

<p>I am, by the kindness of John Smith, Esq., of
Edinburgh, author of <i>Old Scottish Clockmakers</i>, and
of his publisher, William J. Hay, Esq., John Knox's
House, Edinburgh, enabled to produce names and
dates of certain Scottish makers not recorded elsewhere.
In this connection my friend William R.
Miller, Esq., of Leith, has spared no time to help
me to do justice to Scottish makers, and I am
especially grateful to him for his kindly enthusiasm.
He was there at the "chap o' the knok" when I
asked his help.</p>

<p>Westropp Dudley, Esq., of the National Museum,
Dublin, has extended to me his courtesy in enabling
the inclusion of Irish makers coming under his
research. To Arthur Deane, Esq., of the Public
Art Gallery and Museum, Belfast, I am similarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
obliged for data relative to old Belfast clockmakers.</p>

<p>To the many friends who have during an extended
period generously supplemented my own studies by
supplying me with data in regard to provincial
makers and other hitherto unelucidated matters, I
wish to offer my cordial thanks.</p>

<p>To my readers in general, whether they be collectors
of old English china or earthenware, of
furniture, or of prints, or of old silver, I desire to
record my appreciation of their kindness in regard
to my volumes on these subjects. I have honestly
endeavoured to treat each sub-head concerning the
evolution of design in the English home with sane
reasoning, and I trust with ripe judgment. I have
assiduously collected facts and studiously attempted
to marshal them, each by each, according to relative
value. Popular my volumes may be, but it is my
hope that they may contribute something of permanent
value to the subjects with which they deal.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="center">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>

<p class="chapsum">Time and its measurement&mdash;Day and night&mdash;Early
mechanism&mdash;The domestic clock&mdash;The personal
clock&mdash;Rapid phases of invention&mdash;The dawn of
science&mdash;The great English masters of clockmaking&mdash;The
several branches of a great art&mdash;What to
value and what to collect&mdash;Hints for beginners.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dictionary definition of "clock" is interesting.
<i>Clock.</i>&mdash;A machine for measuring time, marking
the time by the position of its hands upon the dial-plate,
or by the striking of a hammer on a bell.
Probably from old French or from Low Latin,
<i>cloca</i>, <i>clocca</i>, a bell. Dutch, <i>klok</i>. German, <i>glocke</i>,
a bell.</p>

<p>This is exact as far as it goes, but the thought
seizes one, how did it come about that man
attempted to measure time? He saw the sunrise
and he watched the fading sunset till "Hesperus
with the host of heaven came," and the night melted
again into the dawn. Nature marked definitely the
hours of light and hours of darkness. That was a
law over which he had no control. Similarly he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
watched the seasons&mdash;the spring, the summer, the
autumn, and the winter; this gave him the annual
calendar. It becomes a matter of curious speculation
how it came to pass that man divided the
year into twelve months, and how he came to give
a name to each day, and to determine seven as
forming a week. Similarly one is curiously puzzled
as to why he divided day and night into twenty-four
parts, calling them hours.</p>

<p>These speculations lead us farther afield than the
scope of this volume. An examination of Babylonian
and Greek measurements of time is too
abstruse to be included in a volume of this nature.
Nor is it necessary, however interesting such may
be, to record the astronomical observations at
Bagdad of Ahmed ibn Abdullah.</p>

<p>We must commence with the known data that
the earth revolves on its axis in twenty-four hours,
or, to be more exact, in 23 hours 56 minutes 4
seconds. Astronomical clocks recording with
scientific exactitude this phenomenon are on a
plane apart, as are chronometers used by mariners.
The astronomer uses a clock with numbers on its
dial plate up to twenty-four; the common clock
has only twelve hour numerals.</p>

<p>To come straight to modernity, it must be
recognized that the measurement of time scientifically
and the measurement of time according to
civil law are two different things.</p>

<p>The mean Solar day used in the ordinary reckoning
of time, by most modern nations, begins at
midnight. Its hours are numbered in two series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
from 1 to 12&mdash;the first series, called A.M. (<i>ante
meridian</i>), before midday, and the second series,
P.M. (<i>post meridian</i>), after midday. This is a
clumsy arrangement and leads to confusion. The
leading railways of the world are beginning to use
the series of twenty-four.</p>

<p>Let it be granted that the day consists of twenty-four
hours, which is the apparent Solar day; the
starting-point was not always the same. The
Babylonians began their day at sunrise, the
Athenians and Jews at sunset, the ancient
Egyptians and Romans at midnight.</p>

<p>In passing, it should be noted that the day is
measured astronomically by recording the period
of the revolution of the earth on its axis, determined
by the interval of time between two successive
transits of the sun, the moon, or a fixed star over
the same meridian.</p>

<p>The Solar day is exactly 24 hours, the Lunar day
is 24 hours 50 minutes, and the Sidereal day is
23 hours 56 minutes.</p>

<p>Apparent Solar Time is shown by the sundial,
and therefore depends upon the motion of the sun.
Mean Solar Time is shown by a correct clock.
The difference between Mean Time and Apparent
Time, that is, between the time shown by the clock
and the sundial, is called the Equation of Time, and
in the <i>Nautical Almanack</i>, a Government publication,
there are tables showing these differences.</p>

<p><b>Day and Night.</b>&mdash;Obviously the hours of darkness
offered a greater problem to the horologist than
the hours of light. His sundial was of no use at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
night and of little use on cloudy days. The hour-glass
was not a piece of mechanism a man would
wish to employ to record the night watches. Some
other self-acting mechanism had to be devised.</p>

<p>The interval between sunset and sunset, or sunrise
and sunrise, or noon and noon, was divided by the
Babylonians, who had a love for the duodenary
system, into twenty-four hours. It is curious to
read that "until the eighteenth century in England
the hour was commonly reckoned as the twelfth
part of the time between sunrise and sunset, or
between sunset and sunrise, and hence was of
varying durations" (<i>Webster's New International
Dictionary</i>, 1914).</p>

<p>The hour was further divided, also by the
Babylonians, into periods of sixty minutes. It was
the Babylonians who first divided the circle into
360 degrees, and Ptolemy followed this division.</p>

<p>The dial of a clock was at first termed the <i>hour-plate</i>,
as only hours were engraved upon it and only
one hand was employed. Later, another hand was
added, the minute hand, which travelled a complete
circuit while the hour hand was travelling between
two hour numerals. Later, again, a new sub-dial
was added, and a seconds hand recorded the sixty
seconds which made the minute. The term "second"
was at first called "second-minute," denoting that
it was the second division of an hour by sixty.
The learned John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, that
extraordinary old savant, writes in 1650: "Four
flames of an equal magnitude will be kept alive the
space of sixteen <i>second-minutes</i>, though one of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
flames alone, in the same vessel, will not last at
most above twenty-five or thirty seconds."</p>

<p>These dry facts may serve to whet the curiosity
of the student in regard to the measurement of
time and its origin. They add a piquancy to
the clock dial as we now know it. Scientific it
is, as one of man's most exact recorders of natural
phenomena. That an exact timekeeper should be
found in the pocket of every schoolboy would seem
an astounding miracle to our ancestors two hundred
years ago, or even less than a hundred years ago:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none</div>
      <div class="verse">Go just alike, yet each believes his own,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>writes Pope in his <i>Essay on Criticism</i> in 1725.</p>

<p>This is a damning indictment of the accuracy of
watches in the early eighteenth century, but Dickens
in <i>Dombey and Son</i> suggests equally faulty mechanism
not in true accord with the mean solar day:</p>

<p>"Wal'r ... a parting gift, my lad. Put it back
half an hour every morning, and about another
quarter towards the arternoon, and it's a watch
that'll do you credit."</p>

<p>That the civil day has taken precedence of the
solar day is shown by the recent legislation in regard
to Summer Time. "The Sabbath was made for man
and not man for the Sabbath," may be applied to
the clock dial. By an Act of Parliament, in spite
of science and the earth's revolution on its axis,
the hands straightway mean something else. It
is well that modern clocks have no wise saws and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
mottoes telling of the unalterable hand of Time;
"Old Time, the clock-setter, that bald sexton,
Time," as Shakespeare says in <i>King John</i>.</p>

<p><b>Early Mechanism.</b>&mdash;The problem for the old clockmakers
who wished to supplant the primitive
measurement of time by candle, by the hour-glass,
and later by the sundial, was to produce a piece
of mechanism which would in twenty-four hours,
the prescribed period of day and night, indicate
the flight of time hour by hour.</p>

<p>In rapid survey we cannot pause to enter into
details. The first clocks indicated the hour alone
by a hand attached to the axis of a wheel. In the
twelfth century a new mechanism was added to
strike a bell with a hammer, showing the hours
indicated by the hand. At first the motive power
was a weight acting upon toothed wheels. In the
fifteenth century a spiral spring placed in a barrel
replaced the weight attached to a string as the
motive power. This led to portable clocks of
smaller dimensions being possible.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century is remarkable for the
great advance by Italian, by Nuremberg, and by
Augsburg clockmakers. Striking and alarum clocks,
and intricate mechanism showing phases of the
moon, the year, the day of the month, and the festivals
of the Church, were produced. In the
sixteenth century portable clocks received further
attention in regard to minute mechanism, resulting
in what we now know as the watch. The moment
this point was reached, ornamentation of a rich
and elaborate character was applied to such objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of art, then only in the possession of princes and
nobles and the richest classes of society.</p>

<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century Huygens,
the celebrated Dutch astronomer and mathematician,
brought great modification in the art of clockmaking
by applying the pendulum to clocks in
order to regulate the movement, "and adapting,
some years later, to the balance of watches a spring,
which produced upon this balance the same effect
as that of the weight upon the pendulum" (Labarte,
<i>Arts of the Middle Ages</i>).</p>

<p>In old clocks there is a verge escapement with a
cross-bar balanced by weights. This was in the
top portion of the clock.</p>

<p>When the pendulum was introduced it was first
placed in front of the clock and swung backwards
and forwards across the face of the dial, being only
some six inches in length, and more frequently it
is found at the back of the clock, outside the case.
See illustration (p. <a href="#i_050a.jpg">51</a>) of examples.</p>

<p>As it was easy safely to convert the old form
of balance into pendulum form, with hanging weight
or weights, this was frequently done. So frequently,
in fact, that very few of the old balance movements
remain. See illustration (p. <a href="#i_056.jpg">57</a>) of lantern clock
with weights and pendulum.</p>

<p>With the advent of the "royal" or long pendulum,
the domestic clock came into being.</p>

<p>We now arrive at the first period of the English
domestic clock, and from this point a fairly definite
record of styles and changes can be made.</p>

<p><b>The Domestic Clock.</b>&mdash;This may be said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the clock in use in a great house, apart from the
cathedral or church clock, the turret clock, or the
more public clock common to the gaze of everybody.
The nobility employed, on the Continent and in
this country, great clockmakers to produce these
new scientific timekeepers for use in their private
apartments. But there came another phase when
the clock visible to the dependent was supplanted
by more delicate mechanism of greater value and
of richer ornamentation.</p>

<p><b>The Personal Clock.</b>&mdash;This was the watch. It
was carried on the person. It was the gift of a
lover to his mistress. It was a rich and rare
jewel of scientific construction, set in crystal, embellished
with enamel and other rich decoration. In
a measure it supplanted the clock and drove it on
to a lower plane.</p>

<p>It demanded craftsmanship of the highest character
to create these masterpieces of horology, and the
art has been continued in a separate stream to
that of clockmaking up to the present day. The
watch is not the small clock, nor is the clock the
large watch. Whatever may have been their
common origin, each has developed on lines
essentially proper for the technique. As the
clock has developed in mechanical perfection, so
the watch has similarly kept in parallel progress
towards the same ideal, that of the perfect timekeeper.</p>

<p>A long succession of mechanical inventions is
attached to the clock, and similarly the watch has
demanded equal genius till both arrive at modernity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Dawn of Science.</b>&mdash;The mid-seventeenth
century the post-Bacon period, when Newton became
President of the Royal Society, may be said
to be the dawn of science in this country. The
Aristotelian method of analysis and the practical
experiment set men's minds into scientific channels.
The scientific clockmaker was the product of this
period of restless activity. Science was in leading-strings.
Prince Rupert's Drops, so familiar now,
were a scientific wonder. Bishop Wilkins and
Evelyn, Locke and Dr. Harvey, were all, from
different points, attempting to unravel the secrets
of nature. The Tudor Age had opened the New
World; the next century was left to discover the
untravelled paths of science and mechanism.
Invention was being suckled by Curiosity. Invention
only came to manhood in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><b>The Great English Masters of Clockmaking.</b>&mdash;There
is the mythical claim for Richard Harris, who is
said to have invented the first pendulum clock in
Europe, fixed in the turret of St. Paul's, Covent
Garden, in 1640 or earlier. The Huygens pendulum
was hung by a silken cord, and the arc described by
the bob or weight at its end was a segment of a
circle. Dr. Hooke invented the thin, flexible steel
support of the pendulum, producing more scientific
accuracy. In 1658 he invented the <i>anchor escapement</i>,
which, together with his spring to the
pendulum, is still used, although the "dead-beat"
escapement invented by George Graham has
supplanted the "anchor" in timekeepers requiring
greater exactitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to Robert Hooke and his claim to
being the inventor of the balance spring for watches,
an invention claimed by Christopher Huygens de
Zulichem, there is an acrimonious dispute and
lengthy correspondence thereon. The Royal
Society had published in their <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>
for March 25th, 1675, the discovery of Huygens,
who visited England in 1661 and was made a
Fellow of the Royal Society. Dr. Hooke protested.
It appears that one of the "ballance double
watches" was presented to Charles II and was
inscribed "Robert Hooke <i>inven.</i> 1658. T. Tompion
<i>fecit</i> 1675." There is the record that George Graham
declared that he "had heard Tompion say he was
employed three months that year by Mr. Hooke in
making some parts of these watches before he
let him know for what use they were designed, and
that Tompion was used to say he thought the first
invention of them was owing to Mr. Hooke."<a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a>
<a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>To come to the great masters of the art of English
clockmaking. In the transactions of the Worshipful
Company of Clockmakers it is recorded that "in
July 1704 it was by the Master reported that certain
persons at Amsterdam are in the habit of putting
the names of Tompion, Windmills, Quare, Cabrier,
Lamb, and other well-known makers on their works
and selling them as English."<a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a>
<a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> A committee was
appointed to put an end to such abuses.</p>

<p>Here then we have five of the leading English
clockmakers in 1704, to which we can add George
Graham, the inventor of the "orrery," named after
his patron, Robert Boyle, Earl of Cork and
Orrery, and to make the number up to twenty-five
we add the following. These men are in
the first flight. Ahasuerus Fromanteel (and the
family of Fromanteel, of Dutch origin), the first to
introduce the pendulum into England; Edward
East; Joseph Knibb, father and son; William Dutton,
Matthew and Thomas Dutton, John Ebsworth, John
Harrison, J. Grant, Stephen Rimbault, Thomas
Earnshaw, John Arnold, Thomas Mudge, Christopher
Pinchbeck, William Tomlinson, Justin Vulliamy, and
Benjamin and Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy.</p>

<p>In <i>Old Clocks and Watches and their Makers</i>, by
the late F. J. Britten, there is a list of some ten
thousand names of clockmakers, so that examples
coming in the possession of collectors can readily
be checked by this list. But the fact that a maker's
name is not in this directory does not exclude him
from recognition as a master, though possibly he
may not be one of the great masters.</p>

<p><b>The Several Branches of a Great Art.</b>&mdash;The timekeeper&mdash;whether
it be the scientific astronomical
clock, or the chronometer used by mariners, or the
modern watch, minute in size but recording time
with accuracy, or the bracket or table clock, or
the long-case clock&mdash;has proceeded on parallel lines
of development. These types represent the several
branches of the great art of clockmaking.</p>

<p>Clockmakers and watchmakers very soon specialized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
when the correct standard had been reached,
and further inventions effected economy in mechanism
rather than drastic changes in principle making
for further exactitude. Specialization may be said
to have undone clockmaking. We realize that the
clockmaker could not cast the brass spandrel
ornaments and chase them, or engrave the dial.
We do not expect him to, nor did he, lay the
marquetry, or become a lacquer varnisher in the
cases. We cannot call upon him to cast the bell in
the chiming movement, or to make the catgut which
is wound around the drum carrying the weights.
Nor was he an expert in metal design to pierce
the hands and employ delicate ornament in so
doing. Perhaps we may forgive him employing a
special trade to supply him with delicate springs.
But the factory system of the middle nineteenth
century began to eat into the vitals of clockmaking
in this country as a scientific craft.
Makers of wheels, makers of chains, makers of
every conceivable part of the movement sprang
into being. No one of whom was a clockmaker,
and no unit of any such industry could put a
clock together. The clockmaker, and even then
there is something personal yet remaining, became
an assembler of component parts. He certainly
understood the completed whole and made the
wheels move and the hands record exact and perfect
time. That is something, and it is a very great
thing too. But how shorn of his former glory is
the clockmaker in these conditions!</p>

<p>In this volume we deal with the collecting period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
which is the stage prior to this, but it is possible
to look ahead as well as backward. Factory-made
clocks will be made, perfect timekeepers
without doubt. But there is still the great
possibility that the clockmaker may seize his own
and wrest the laurels from the impersonal syndicate.
To him who can add personality to a clock&mdash;that
something which parts put together with mechanical
precision lack&mdash;there awaits a glorious heritage. The
soul of the living clock must echo the soul of its
human maker. The old masters have left to
posterity living organisms which will not die. It
rests with the public to say whether they prefer
the gramophone to the singer, the piano-player to
the accomplished pianist. If the clock of tomorrow
is to be a mere soulless machine, the demand
will be met. But if it is to revert to that higher
plane of the old masters of clockmaking, it is for
those who love beauty and truth to make their
desires imperative. For the moment, therefore, the
study of the old and the perfect claims the loving
attention of the collector who sees new lamps, like
those which the magician in Aladdin's palace
proffered for sale, in place of old.</p>

<p><b>What to Value and what to Collect.</b>&mdash;The appreciation
of old clocks is a natural gift. To one his
mezzotints, to another his Chelsea china, to another
his old silver plate. But to all lovers of fine furniture
the English clock appeals sympathetically. It
has a twofold claim to recognition. It is, if it be a
fine old English clock by an English maker, a reliable
piece of mechanism as a timekeeper. It is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
certain periods representative, in its marquetry or
lacquered case, of styles of decoration and design
now only equalled by copyists. If it is by one of
the leading English clockmakers its movements are
unequalled. It stands as a monument to a great
scientific craftsmanship now almost extinct. The
great English clockmakers of the first flight "were
not of an age but for all time."</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the first twenty-five years of
the eighteenth century and the first thirty-five years
of the nineteenth century represent two periods
when the clockmaker was doing splendid work.
The clocks of the intervening period are of value
as representing work of extreme carefulness, and
are of course worthy of the attention and admiration
of the collector.</p>

<p>In the first period a crowd of skilled scientific
clockmakers followed each other in rapid succession
and brought the art of horology to perfection.
During this first period the clock cases and the
clock dials came under artistic impulses not since
equalled. It therefore follows that for these two
reasons the clocks of the first period are most highly
appreciated and are of great value.</p>

<p>The second period, that is, the first thirty-five
years of the nineteenth century, represents an era
of established and sound technique, exhibiting
craftsmanship of a high order struggling for supremacy
and recognition at a time when factory
inventions and factory-made substitutes commenced
to dominate not only the art of the clockmaker but
other personal crafts. During this time the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and the dial cannot be said to possess the high
artistic qualities found in the earlier period. Art
was beginning to sink into the Slough of Despond
which for half a century characterized most
European arts, both fine and applied.</p>

<p><b>Hints for Beginners.</b>&mdash;To set out to buy an old
clock is for the tyro like setting out to buy a horse.
In the latter case the teeth may be filed and the
hoofs pared to give a simulation of youth to which
possibly the beast could not lay claim. In the
former, added touches would counterfeit antiquity:
here a pair of apparently old hands, there
an antiquated-looking dial, and an enshrining case
of no particular period, but seeming to bear Time's
own impress of age, till one is inclined to say, to
quote the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>: "I never knew so
young a body with so old a head."</p>

<p>The following chapters will indicate the outline
of a complex and intricate subject. The case, the
dial, the hands, all have to be studied with no little
skill in comparison and deduction in regard to
errors in clumsy repairers or unskilled restorers,
who with vandal hands have destroyed the balance
of fine work and introduced component parts which
are harlequin to the trained collector's eye. This
much for the <i>visible</i>. Then there is the movement,
that is, the mechanism which makes the clock a
clock. This is unseen by the average snapper-up of
old clocks, or when seen not understood. There are
those collectors who stop short in their requirements.
A clock is an ornament to a well appointed home,
in the hall, in the smoking-room, or in the dining-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
They are unconcerned as to whether it is a
timekeeper or a monument, "long to be patient
and silent to wait like a ghost that is speechless."
One longs to call aloud to such an encumbrance with
its dead wheels and its atrophied hands: "Watchman!
What of the night?" It is a servant that
serves no longer. It is like a poor relation thrusting
his company upon his fellow-guests with dumb
tongue and a solemn demeanour telling of former
glories.</p>

<p>But the sane modern collector wants an old clock
not because it is old, but because he rightly has
assumed that there are certain qualities of the
old clockmaker's art which are not to be found in
later periods. Wise in his generation, he places
himself not in the hands of a dealer who has sold
a thousand clocks, but in the hands of a practical
clockmaker who has made one. A trained man
having a knowledge of old movements, and to
whom they are something more than inanimate
objects, will advise the collector. To such a man a
clock is something with a soul. To him one goes
who will set the silent wheels moving and endow
the dead clockmaker's heritage with pulsating life.</p>

<p>But&mdash;the word of warning cannot be too strongly
sounded to all possessors of old clocks. Every year
fine examples of old work are ruined for ever by
ignorant repairers and restorers. In their little day
they have destroyed movements and parts which
can never be replaced. Of all arts, the art of the
clockmaker has suffered most at the hands of the
modern destroyer of work he does not understand.</p>

<p class="center">THE BRASS LANTERN CLOCK</p>

<p class="chapsum">The domestic clock&mdash;Its use as a bracket or wall
clock&mdash;Seventeenth-century types&mdash;Continuance of
manufacture in provinces&mdash;Their appeal to the
collector.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> form of the lantern clock is one that appeals
to the artist. We love the candelabrum with
candles, with its finely, fashioned brass forms, Dutch
and English. It adds a grace to the interiors of
the old masters of the Low Countries. Nobody
is especially interested in the gas bracket or the
paraffin lamp. There is the picture of <i>The Doctor</i>
by Luke Fildes, but here the lamp only adds to
the poverty and anguish of the scene. It is realistic
and had to be there, and it makes a great factor
in the lighting. But the chandelier with candles
is the most beloved by the artist who inclines to
the primitive, as we all do. The electric light must
come into art and it does. The lift and the
telephone are facts, but they are difficult, naked
and unashamed as they are, to clothe with √¶sthetic
drapery. The cubist and the modern pseudo-scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
realist revel in incongruities repellent
to art. They seize these as their own, and make
them in their presentation more repellent.</p>

<p>Happily the clock has not received the attention
of the modern sensation-monger. We are left with
the heritage of the past undisturbed. He may gibe
at the paint and canvas of old masters, he may
deride the grace of the Greek in sculpture, but
the simple mechanism of the clock symbolizing "the
inaudible and noiseless foot of Time" mocks the
charlatan of a little day, with oblivion tracking his
scurrying heels.</p>

<p>The name of lantern clock may puzzle the modern
collector, but its shape followed the lantern of the
period, and, like the lantern, it was made to hang on
the wall. We illustrate (p. <a href="#i_046a.jpg">47</a>) a silver ship's lantern
of the period of Christian IV of Denmark, of the late
sixteenth century, with the King's monogram. It
was doubtless used in the expedition round the
North Cape. It is in the collection at Rosenborg
Castle at Copenhagen. This lantern shape is found
in German clocks of the period, and in English
seventeenth-century clocks the same shape is
continued. A fine example by Bartholomew
Newsam is illustrated (p. <a href="#i_046b.jpg">47</a>), showing the early
type conforming to the lantern design.</p>

<p>Not only the form but the usage determined the
name. The lantern had spikes or metal hooks to
hang upon. The clock similarly was affixed to
a wall, and we know it as a bracket clock, because,
whether on a wall or on a bracket, it had chains
and weights suspended beneath it, as it was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>in its early form capable of being placed on a
table.</p>

<p>We think lovingly of it as belonging to a past
that is something more than tapestry figures moving
in a misty background. To watch the revolving
pinions of a Stuart clock is to hear the echoes of the
past reverberate. It requires no gramophone to
reproduce dead voices, nor a cinema picture to recall
bygone incidents and happenings. One can listen
to the same monotone calling forth the departure
of the seconds that awakened George Herbert from
a reverie and beat rhythmically to his carefully
wrought verse. The same hand pointed to midnight
that beckoned Lovelace from his revels. We are
reminded of Justice Shallow's "we have heard the
chimes at midnight,"&mdash;an old man's boast of rollicking
gaiety. The trite engraved words <i>Tempus fugit</i>
drew a thousand sweet sounds from golden-mouthed
Herrick, who sang of fading roses and counselled
maids "with Daffodils and Daisies crowned" to
make the most of their charms. <i>Vanitas vanitatum</i>,
all is vanity; the sadness of it all, the flying
hours that no man can recall, the long slow shadow
that creeps across the grass&mdash;this is the message
of the poets; and when they pause for a moment
from the dance in the sunlight to think of time,
it is Time the ancient reaper with the scythe, who
cuts down the young flowers ruthlessly with the
fateful sweep of his blade.</p>

<p><b>Its Use as a Bracket or Wall Clock.</b>&mdash;Old engravings
of clocks and of clockmakers' workshops show
clocks on the wall with the weights suspended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
beneath the brass case. Such a clock usually went
for thirty hours. That is, it was usual to wind it
by pulling up the chains once a day, a method
retained, in long-case clocks of thirty-hour duration,
by provincial makers a couple of centuries later in
England.</p>

<p>It is obvious that these clocks stand apart from
the era of the spring as a driving force, being
weight-driven, and are before the introduction of
the pendulum as a regulator of the mechanism
impelled by the weights.</p>

<p>As timekeepers they never can bear comparison
with the later type with the long pendulum. They
stand as examples of early clockmaking, with fine
brass dials, with artistic appearance, simple and
unpretentious, but lacking the real scientific application
of further developed principles of a succeeding
period.</p>

<p>A clock that could only be used as a bracket
clock or a wall clock with weights beneath hardly
filled the requirements of an age when domestic
furniture demanded luxury and exquisite taste.
The personal clock&mdash;that is, the watch&mdash;offered more
possibilities.</p>

<p>The advent of the pendulum came just at a time
when the art of the clockmaker required the necessary
impetus to carry him to newer and more
extended fields. The invention revolutionized the
domestic clock.</p>

<p>As to the clocks used by the wealthy classes in
England at the year 1685, one recalls the death-bed
scene of Charles II as described by Macaulay:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
"The morning light began to peep through the
windows of Whitehall; and Charles desired the
attendants to pull aside the curtains, that he might
have one more look at the day. He remarked that
it was time to wind up a clock that stood near his
bed. These little circumstances were long remembered,
because they proved beyond dispute
that, when he declared himself a Roman Catholic,
he was in full possession of his faculties. He
apologized to those who had stood round him
all night for the trouble which he caused. He had
been, he said, a most unconscionable time dying;
but he hoped that they would excuse it. This was
the last glimpse of that exquisite urbanity so often
found potent to charm away the resentment of a
justly incensed nation. Soon after dawn the speech
of the dying man failed."</p>

<p>It was Bacon who wrote, a century before: "If a
man be in sickness or pain, the time will seem longer
without a clock or hour-glass than with it."</p>

<p>The question arises as to what particular kind
of clock was at the bedside of Charles II that he
should notice that it required winding. It may
have been usual to wind it at that particular time
every morning, being, as it undoubtedly was, a
thirty-hour clock conveniently wound the same
time every day. But it is more probable that
the King saw that it wanted winding by the position
of the weights.</p>

<p><b>Seventeenth-century Types.</b>&mdash;The idea of the
pendulum had been in men's minds since the days
of Leonardo da Vinci, but Christopher Huygens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the Dutch astronomer and mechanician, applied it to
the clock. At first it was placed in front of the dial
and swung from the top. The illustration we give
(p. <a href="#i_050a.jpg">51</a>) shows an early clock with this device. The
pendulum was next placed at the back (see adjacent
illustration, p. <a href="#i_050b.jpg">51</a>), and later inside the clock.</p>

<p>We illustrate several types of the lantern clock
showing its changing form from a slender and
graceful clock, with the dial in correct proportion,
to the later type, when the dial projected beyond
the body of the clock. When the bell was placed
at the top and ornamented by a brass terminal, the
name applied to the clock was "birdcage," and
pictures by the old Dutch masters show birdcages
of this shape hanging in ladies' boudoirs.</p>

<p>It will be observed that as a rule the dials are
circular, consisting of the hour plate without the
four spandrels. But we illustrate an example of a
square dial by John Bushman, London, about 1680,
with crown and verge escapement, with short pendulum,
and alarum with striking and going trains
run by same weight. It will be observed that these
clocks have only one hand&mdash;the hour hand. In
the example above mentioned (see Frontispiece), the
dial has an inner circle showing quarters of an hour.
The hand, as illustrated, has passed one quarter and
half of the next; it is therefore about twenty-two
and a half minutes past three. There is also an
alarum marked with arabic figures one to twelve.
(An enlargement of this dial is illustrated p. <a href="#i_162a.jpg">163</a>)</p>

<p>The other specimens we illustrate exhibit slightly
varying characteristics.</p>

<p>The brass lantern clock illustrated (p. <a href="#i_054a.jpg">55</a>) has
chains and weights. It is a thirty-hour clock, with
striking but no alarum movement. It has a short
pendulum behind the back plate.</p>

<p>The use of an anchor-shaped pendulum brought
a winged screen into fashion to conceal its movement.
The example illustrated (p. <a href="#i_054b.jpg">55</a>) shows this
style. This also is a bracket clock with chains
supporting the weights.</p>

<p>But the bracket clock did not stop at this stage.
On the introduction of the long or seconds pendulum
this new mechanism was embodied in brass
clocks, and the illustration (p. <a href="#i_056.jpg">57</a>) of an example
about 1700 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New
York, shows this type. A fine brass lantern clock
by Thomas Tompion is at the British Museum,
an illustration of which is given (p. <a href="#i_060.jpg">61</a>).</p>


<p><b>Continuance of Manufacture in the Provinces.</b>&mdash;Long
after the long-case clock was in general use in
London, the brass clock with weights and pendulum
was extensively made in the provinces. Examples
are found by local makers up to the early years
of the nineteenth century. In a measure this
continuance of an obsolete form is parallel with
the village cabinet-maker's furniture. Generation
after generation produced oak chairs and settles in
Stuart form, and when Chippendale seized the world
of fashion, it was not till long afterwards that
village craftsmen made chairs in the Chippendale
manner&mdash;but in yew, in beech, and in sycamore,
never in mahogany. Even Sheraton's satinwood
elegance in delicate tapered legs found an echo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in elm and beech. It is such na√Øvet√© which is
delightful to the collector, and in provincial clocks
he will find a study equally rewarded by extraordinary
anachronisms and singular adaptations within
the compass of the local maker.</p>

<p>For instance, the marquetry of the village
carpenter is always a hundred years behind the
time. His engraving on dials is of the same
character as that on his local coffin-plates or his
tombstones. His painted dials often exhibit native
touches difficult to equal.</p>

<p><b>Their Appeal to Collectors.</b>&mdash;Anything that appeals
to collectors, whether it be Morland's colour prints
or Wheatley's <i>Cries of London</i>, old Sheffield plate,
Stuart cane-back chairs or Sheraton tea-caddies,
pays the usual tribute which the antique pays to
posterity. As imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery, a thousand replicas start up to supply a
demand. The man of taste says that such and
such a thing is unique in its art-appeal to him. The
man of money seeks to prove that it is not unique
and buys as many uniques and antiques as his distended
banking account will allow. We find this
applies to lantern clocks. Birmingham has turned
out thousands of these brass clocks in replica
of seventeenth-century styles. Sometimes as much
as ten pounds is asked for them, and sometimes it is
found that an old maker's name has been added to
the dial. There is no particular harm in any man
having replicas of fine old objects of art in his
house if he likes the styles and cannot afford
originals. But it is a pity that any one should ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
pay more than replica price for a copy. That is
foolishness, and outside the realm of collecting.</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps it is a wise dispensation of Providence
that the man of wealth can possess the originals
and that the poor man and the man of taste must
content himself with copies. It was Balzac who
chalked up in his garret, "Here is a Velasquez,"
"Here is an Andrea del Sarto." Lovers of the real
can impart to the modern replicas purchased for a
few pounds the spirit of the old examples. It
is the same artistic impulse which accepts the
translation in lieu of the original. Through FitzGerald
we read Omar. Horatius Flaccus, who appeals
to the esoteric with his <i>odi profanum vulgus</i>, is filtered
through a Western tongue. One is grateful to see
plaster casts in the British Museum of the Three
Fates from the Parthenon at Athens. Echoes suggest
so much to those who have the inner spirit to
conjure up the original.</p>

<p class="center">THE LONG-CASE CLOCK&mdash;THE PERIOD OF VENEER AND MARQUETRY</p>

<p class="chapsum">What is veneer?&mdash;What is marquetry?&mdash;The use of
veneer and marquetry on long-case clocks&mdash;No common
origin of design&mdash;Le style r√©fugi√©&mdash;Derivative
nature of marquetry clock-cases&mdash;The wall-paper
period&mdash;The incongruities of marquetry.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some fifty years&mdash;that is, from about 1670,
the date of the secret treaty of Charles II with
Louis XIV, to about the year 1720, the early
years of the reign of George I&mdash;there was a
marked leaning towards colour in furniture as distinct
from form. The solid English oak of early
days and the later intricacies of walnut were
dependent solely on form, either in carving or in
elaborate turning, as in the Charles II and James II
period, when the so-called "barley-sugar" pattern
and other elaborate "corkscrew" turned legs added
grace and beauty to furniture beginning to take
its place beside the work of great European
craftsmen.</p>

<p>In flattering imitation of continental schools, but
more particularly the Dutch, English cabinet-makers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
commenced to inlay their furniture with ivory and
coloured woods, and designs embodying conventional
birds and flowers became of frequent use. A considerable
amount of skill was employed in adopting
this new art, which necessitated the careful laying
of veneer. In comparison with the ordinary Dutch
cabinet-work, this derivative English furniture
exhibits, in a measure, finished work of a high
degree in regard to the exactitude of cabinet-work
which surpassed the prototypes. The English craftsman
was working in a new medium, and he
apparently was exceptionally careful in handling
its technique.</p>

<p>In the reign of William of Orange, as may be
imagined, with his Dutch retinue and the Dutch
influences at Court, the style received a great
impetus and the country was flooded with Dutch
art. This impress of the House of Nassau is left
upon Hampton Court, with its canal, its avenues,
and its formal gardens. What Charles II and
his exiled cavaliers brought in spirit from The
Hague, William brought in reality when he landed
at Torbay in 1698.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that in 1685 and in the
immediately succeeding years, owing to the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV, fifty
thousand Huguenot families fled from France to
escape a horrible fate at the hands of their Roman
Catholic fellow-countrymen. In vain the Archbishop
of Canterbury directed the clergy not to dwell on the
sufferings of the French Protestants, and in spite
of James II, whose sympathies were with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
persecutors, the sum of forty thousand pounds was
collected in the English churches and handed over
to the Chamber of London. This was a great sum
in those days to be raised thus voluntarily. Three
years afterwards James ignominiously fled to the
Continent and a second Revolution ended the Stuart
dynasty. Thousands of skilled workmen settled
in London. At Spitalfields they erected silk-looms;
they represented the best type of artist craftsmen,
silversmiths, woodworkers, glass-blowers, cabinet-makers,
designers, and other artistic industries.
Their advent was an artistic asset to this country.
The Duke of Buckingham ten years earlier had
procured a number of expert glassworkers from
Venice and had established the manufacture of
glass and mirrors at Vauxhall.</p>

<p><b>What is Veneer?</b>&mdash;The art of veneering is of ancient
origin. It has a long record before it reaches what
we now know as veneering. To make a rapid
survey we must commence with the art of inlay.
This art may be in metal upon metal, as in damascening;
stone upon stone, as in <i>pietra dura</i>; porcelain,
terra-cotta, enamel, or coloured glass, as in mosaic
work; or wood upon wood, as in intarsia; which
subsequently became marquetry. The inlays in all
these techniques are cut into cubes, hexagons,
triangles, or other forms, often of very minute size,
to form broad designs, as in marble pavements, or
surfaces of great area such as the dome of St. Mark's
at Venice, the choicest home of mosaic work in
the world. From these grandeurs to the Tunbridge
ware trinket-boxes with their intricate patterns, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the nicely fitting lids of Scottish snuff-boxes, is a
far cry, but they embody the same principle.</p>

<p>Veneering may therefore be comprehensively
described as overlaying or inlaying one body with
portions of another. A veneer may be plain, without
inlay or marquetry, such as a plain panel of
mahogany affixed or laid on to a body of oak or
some other wood. But in practice it has been so
much used as a groundwork for the art of inlay
and marquetry that it is difficult to separate them.</p>

<p>There is a prevalent idea that veneer has a
sinister meaning. The comparison has been made
between solid and veneer, as though the former
were true and the latter something false, parallel
with the distinction Pope made&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">Worth makes the man, the want of it, the fellow;</div>
      <div class="verse">The rest is all but leather or prunello.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There is every reason why such a notion should
be held as true. It is true of modern cabinet-work
of the shoddy type, where pine is veneered with
mahogany and walnut and passed off as solid.
But the collector is dealing with a period when
veneering was an art adopted for sound decorative
and technical reasons and not solely for purposes
of gain.</p>

<p>The old craftsman found it impossible to make
cabinets and other pieces of furniture of rare
wood, such as ebony, tulip-wood, rosewood, satinwood,
and others. It was not always workable in
such fashion; its weight was one factor against its
employment in the solid. But in introducing panels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and fronts of these richly decorative woods the
cabinet-maker of the late seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries brought colour into his work and employed
the highest artistry. The sound construction of
these old veneered cabinets was before the days of
machinery; veneers or slices of the wood to be
laid on were cut by hand, and were one-eighth of
an inch thick, hence their stability. Nowadays
sheets of veneer are saw-cut and knife-cut, and with
modern machinery the former vary from twelve to
fifteen to the inch, and the latter average about
forty sheets to the inch, although sheets can be cut,
incredible as it may seem, of the thinness of a
cigarette paper.</p>

<p><b>What is Marquetry?</b>&mdash;Marquetry is the inlaying
of wood into wood. We have already seen that
other inlays have their respective techniques and
names. But there is the question as to the application
of the old word "tarsia," which apparently
in the early days included both wood and metal
inlays. "Intarsia" is the term applied to that particular
early type of marquetry which brought
inlaying coloured woods to such perfection in two
great schools, the Italian and the German. By
means of woods, either of their natural colour or
stained, woodworkers produced pictures in wood.
Great Italian masters drew for the Italian school
of artist craftsmen. Just as the dome of St. Mark's
at Venice shows the successive styles of mosaic
work executed during several centuries from Byzantine
to Italian, so the choir stalls show the work
of the cloistered <i>intarsiatori</i> at the cathedral at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Siena, at the cathedral and at S. Maria Novella,
Florence, at Perugia, at Lucca, at Pavia, at Genoa,
and at Savona.</p>

<p>Small pieces of carefully selected wood were
inserted into darker wood panels to produce fanciful
devices or pictures, with perspective and even
tone. This intricate art resembled that of the
mosaic-worker, whose more ambitious works have
taken from fifteen to twenty years to execute.
Some of the tesser√¶ in this technique are hardly
larger than a pin's head. Day by day they were
patiently laid on the cement to form the design.
Similarly in the old intarsia days the workers did
not heed time. They selected their delicate little
pieces of coloured wood and proceeded to lay their
panels and stalls for posterity.</p>

<p>The German school of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries attracted considerable attention,
at Nuremberg, at Augsburg, at Dresden, and at
Munich. In North Germany intarsia was principally
employed on smaller articles, such as cabinets,
chairs, coffers, although L√ºbeck and Danzig furnish
fine examples in the panelling of the town-halls.
In South Germany, in closer touch with Italian
influence, the practice was more diverse; sideboards,
doors, bedsteads, panelling, friezes, and even
gables to ch√¢teaus, received this ornamentation.</p>

<p>Augsburg and Nuremberg developed an industry
and exported their marquetry. This suggests the
first attempt at duplication. Black on white and
white on black, male and female as they are termed
in the trade, or later, in France, Boulle and counter-Boulle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
were exported. The slicing of design and
the manipulation of the knife, and later the saw,
came into operation to fret out the pattern. In its
subsequent development marquetry left the inlaying,
piece by piece, and as tools became more perfect
easier methods were employed. Whether Andr√©
Boulle, in his <i>atelier</i> under Louis XIV, invented the
process or whether he got it from Germany through
Holland is immaterial to the present argument. His
brass and tortoiseshell marquetry set a fashion to
all succeeding craftsmen. He has given his name
to his particular style; though it has been "defamed
by every charlatan and soiled with all ignoble use"
and corrupted to "Buhl," but there is no reason
why <i>Boulle</i> should not stand, although Webster's
Dictionary knows him not.</p>

<p>Practically, nowadays marquetry is the cutting
of thin sheets of wood which have been superimposed
upon each other, and when taken apart,
after the desired pattern has been cut away, fit
into each other to produce the desired colour
effect. For instance, a sheet of walnut, dark
brown, placed over a sheet of sycamore, light
yellow, has a pattern pasted on it in paper. The
delicate fret-saw traces this pattern and cuts
through both light and dark woods. The result
is that the light-wood surface is left with a perforation
ready to receive the piece cut from its
fellow, the dark wood, and <i>vice versa</i>. That is just
what the marquetry-worker does. He transposes
the piece of sycamore to the walnut surface and fits
it in, showing a yellow design on dark brown, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
similarly the walnut piece, fitted in place or the
sycamore ground, shows a brown design on a
yellow surface. This is only a simple outline of
the process, as more than two sheets are placed
together. In its intricacies it represents one of the
most delicate and highly skilled crafts in connection
with cabinet-making. The adept at jig-saw
puzzles may draw a seemly parallel between his
pastime and the patient artistry of the artist-craftsman.</p>

<p><b>The Use of Veneer and Marquetry.</b>&mdash;In its decoration
and in its form the long-case or "grandfather"
clock is as Dutch as the tiles of Haarlem. Derivative
as is English art, the sharp line of a new
introduction is rarely so clearly defined as in the
instance of the late seventeenth-century long-case
clock. As a long wooden case it was itself an innovation.
Being new, it was never at any previous time
English, and it started its history under Dutch
auspices, as in similar manner the pendulum was
introduced into England by Fromanteel. There is
no mistaking its origin. It comes straight from
the placid canals and waterways, the prim and
well-ordered farmsteads, or the richly loaded
burghers' houses of the Low Countries. It has
become as thoroughly English as the Keppels and
the Bentincks.</p>

<div class="center caption">(<i>By courtesy of H. Wingate, Esq., Rochester.</i>)</div>

<p>In regard to clock-cases, it is mostly found that
the veneer has been laid upon an oak body.
Usually the main surface is of walnut, into which
the design has been inlaid by the use of other
woods of suitable colours. At first the marquetry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
was in reserves or panels, as though the worker
were warily picking his way and timidly mastering
the technique. At this period clock-cases were, on
account of the small space to be inlaid, very fit
subjects for experiment. Doubtless some of the
more ambitious work of the early years of this
half-century (1670-1720) was actually produced by
Dutch and also by French workmen settled in this
country, and doubtless the clock-cases were largely
imported. In either instance this would account
for the early adoption of small articles such as
clock-cases, after which followed chairs and tables,
and finally larger pieces of furniture such as bureaus,
when the cabinet-maker was master of the new art
of laying veneer and marquetry, or when the public
taste had advanced sufficiently to induce him to
embark on more elaborate work.</p>

<p>It is not easy to lay down any exact rules as to
the priority of certain styles of marquetry. Many
of them overlap in regard to date. It all depends
on the point of view. Huguenot craftsmen or
Dutch marquetry-workers could, and possibly did,
make in London many such an example as the
fine case with panels (illustrated p. <a href="#i_074.jpg">75</a>) containing
the movement by James Leicester, in date 1710, or
the other example, in date about 1690 (illustrated
p. <a href="#i_236.jpg">237</a>), with the movement by Joseph Knibb, of
Oxford, placed in the chapter on provincial makers
as a glorious tribute to those great makers who
worked outside the metropolis. In this earlier case
of the Knibb clock it will be seen that there are
only two panels, and they exhibit, in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
with the James Leicester clock, a finer sense of
proportion in relation to the surface to be decorated.
It may not unreasonably be advanced, where the
nicety of balance is well sustained, that the maker
set out to make a clock-case with the dimensions
fully before him as a marquetry-worker and not
merely as a mechanical layer of imported panels.
There is the suggestion in cut panels that they were
not thought out in accord with the English clock-case,
with its hole showing the pendulum.</p>

<p>Of exceptional interest is the fine clock by
J. Windmills. The marquetry case of this clock
has been untouched, and its condition, as shown
by the illustration (p. <a href="#i_076a.jpg">77</a>), helps to prove a point.
It is clear that the panel of marquetry was not
intended by the craftsman who laid it to have a
hole to show the pendulum. The design shows
the disturbance caused by this unexpected innovation.
The enlarged hood shows the broken frieze,
an accident frequently attending old examples.
But the frame in hood around glass has been laid
in marquetry by a coarser hand in an attempt to
be in keeping with the panel of the door in case
below. The somewhat clumsy joinery of the door

<p>Frequently cases offer curious obstacles to preconceived
ideas. Take, for example, the fine case
with the movement by Henry Harper of the period
from 1690 to 1695 illustrated (p. <a href="#i_080.jpg">81</a>). As far as
it is possible to determine, it would seem that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
specimen of marquetry belongs to a later period,
certainly more advanced than the panel period.
With so fine a field of design to select from, no
marquetry-worker would take this design from a
Persian carpet at the beginning of the style. This
case represents the highest Dutch feeling and
technique as assimilated in this country, and the
carved brackets have a distinctly Marot character.
It stands as a superlative example of marquetry
decoration.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that a clockmaker, as the
differences in sizes of many of these clocks are not
great, found an earlier case ready to his hand, or a
client desired a particular style of decoration, and
he accordingly put his new clock of 1710 into a
case twenty or thirty years earlier. Or it may be
that some marquetry-worker reproduced the former
style. Whichever may have happened we cannot
say&mdash;these are the conundrums left as a heritage to
the collector, who now comes two hundred years
later.</p>

<p>The fine example of a clock by Martin, London
(1710), illustrated (p. <a href="#i_084.jpg">85</a>), is well balanced, and typifies
the marquetry in an early period. The turned
pillar has not yet disappeared, and is reminiscent of
the fine Tompion cases with turned pillars. It exhibits
the transitional stage before marquetry entirely
supplanted the older style. In this specimen the
marquetry is under fine artistic control.</p>

<p>In what for convenience of expression we term
the "all-over" period the marquetry-worker ran
riot. Not only in colour, for he had to compete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
with the richly coloured lacquered cases, but in
form. But he had as a craftsman learned the art
of laying his imported marquetry sheets where he
willed. He was not deterred from rounded surfaces,
and the cramped pattern of the panel was discarded,
to make way for the style where the pattern, like
chintz or wall-paper, conveniently repeated itself.</p>

<p>There is no mistaking such an example, splendid
though it is, as exemplifying this period illustrated
(p. <a href="#i_086.jpg">87</a>), for the quieter and more reticent style of
panel-work with design in due subjection.</p>

<p>The student will desire to take cognizance of
country-made marquetry cases. Marquetry was
practised in England before this outburst of colour
and form on the clock-case. Occasionally settles
and buffets&mdash;very occasionally&mdash;had stringing in a
thin pattern of black and white intarsia work.
Provincial makers are therefore a delight as well
as a confoundment to the collector. A cabinet-maker
in Devonshire or a would-be marquetry-worker
in Cumberland may, between his intervals
of making the coffins for his deceased neighbours
or turning their wagon shafts, essay to try his
hand at imitating the squire's clock-case of fifty
years' previous date. He usually puts a label to
his handiwork which renders it easily recognizable.
There is no <i>style r√©fugi√©</i> about his craftsmanship.
His design is crudely "chopped in," that is, the
solid wood has been cut out to receive the pieces
of the design, usually, as found now, very badly
glued, and severely handled by time. This is
interesting as showing 'prentice work&mdash;that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
'prentice work coming many years after the finished
art had been established in this country. It is
remarkable that no such apprentice work appears
in London-made examples. The conclusion to
which one must come is that there was no such
apprenticeship. Foreign refugees made the clock-cases
or they were imported from Holland.</p>

</div>

<p><b>No Common Origin of Design.</b>&mdash;All art is derivative.
It is not a crime for the craftsman to assimilate the
best of all the great artists who have preceded him.
This was the insanity of <i>L'Art Nouveau</i>. It wanted
to commence again at elementary principles and
to use poor forms that had long been discarded by
great artificers. It wished us deliberately to ignore
the past. An anvil has arrived by a process of
evolution through long centuries of metal-workers,
since man first smelted ore and fashioned metal,
to its present form. It would be idle to equip the
blacksmith with a square anvil.</p>

<p>From China to Japan, from India to Armenia,
from Bagdad to Cairo, from Alexandria to Venice,
from Canton to Goa and thence to Lisbon, backwards
and forwards across the world's trade routes
art impulses have throbbed to the tune of the
monsoons. Pulsating with life, they carried, and
still carry, Eastern ideas to the West, and Western
inventions to the East. Behind modernity and man's
latest devices somnolently lies the great dead past&mdash;China
and the Far East, Persia and Babylon,
Egypt and Greece and Rome. Aztec gods and
Ashanti gold ornaments, Peruvian Inca clay vessels
and Malayan idols, surprise and bewilder the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
ethnologist with the similarity of rudimentary forms
or with the marvellously pure ornament that comes
out of the so-conceived dark corners of the earth to
suggest older civilizations as artistic as those of
the modern world.</p>

<p><b>Le Style R√©fugi√©.</b>&mdash;The history of art is not
hidden. Holbein and Hollar and Vandyck, Lely
and Kneller worked in this country. The number
of foreign artists and artist-craftsmen working in
this country as acclimatized or as "naturalized"
was stupendous. The beautiful swags and delicately
carved woodwork embellishing so many
English houses and proudly held as heirlooms are
by a Dutchman's hand&mdash;Grinling Gibbons. The
list could be extended. It is natural that the gold
of England should have a hypnotic attraction
to artistic temperaments. It is the law of supply
and demand. Like bananas and pineapples, oranges
and dates, foreign talent comes to a great emporium.</p>

<p>The <i>style r√©fugi√©</i> was something definite. It was
a term employed in Holland just at the time when
a similar immigration was occurring in this country.
The French Protestant refugees fleeing from the
insane fury of Roman Catholic bigots naturally
fled to Protestant countries&mdash;to England, to Holland,
and to Germany. It is admitted on the Continent
that these highly skilled artist craftsmen had
an influence on the art of the country of their adoption.
It is acknowledged as <i>le style r√©fugi√©</i>. In England,
writers on furniture have half-heartedly alluded to
this influence, but it was very real. Daniel Marot,
a descendant from an eminent family of French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
artists, a pupil of Lepautre, formerly at the Gobelins
factory, and one of the creators of the Louis Quatorze
style, took refuge in Holland, where William of
Orange appointed him as Minister of Works.
From The Hague he followed his patron to England
at the "Glorious Revolution." It was his
genius in design that made our William and Mary
and Queen Anne styles. At Hampton Court his
personality predominates. Sir Christopher Wren
occupied himself with the architecture, but the
decorations are by Daniel Marot. Marot died in
1718. He stands in the forefront of the exponents
of <i>le style r√©fugi√©</i>, and behind him are
hundreds of his compatriots. It is idle to ignore
this influence.</p>

<p>Chippendale owed more than most people imagine
to Marot. <i>Le style chinois</i> is to be found, so to
speak, in embryo, in Marot's design books, and
suggestions of it appear in some of his executed
work.</p>

<p>The un-English marquetry became acclimatized,
and later, as we shall show, the equally un-English
lac became a fashion.</p>

<p><b>Derivative Nature of Marquetry Clock-cases.</b>&mdash;The
laying of marquetry as a craft is one thing, the conception
of marquetry as a creative art is another.
We may admire the dexterity of the inlay but
deplore the design. At the Mortlake tapestry
works Vandyck and Rubens made drawings for
the craftsmen. In England, whenever the craftsman
has been allied with the artist he has produced
great results; whenever he has run alone he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
rapidly run downhill. Josiah Wedgwood had on
the one side Bentley the classical scholar, on the
other Flaxman the artist and modeller with a
perfect continental training. Chippendale, great
craftsman that he was, would have been better
advised to prune his Chinese taste and discard his
worthless Gothic style. An artistic brain behind
him would have saved him from such atrocities.
Sheraton, more the artist than the craftsman, made
no such blunders.</p>

<p>Evidently the making of clock-cases became an
industry. Personally we incline to the belief that
seventy-five per cent. of them were of foreign
manufacture, either in Holland and imported here,
or made by Dutch immigrants or French refugees in
this country. The derivative nature of their design
tells its own story. It has nothing English about
it. Take the early geometric star pattern or the
early coloured birds and flowers, what else are they
but Dutch? Is there anything in English art like
them? The conclusion to which one must arrive is
that the marquetry clock-case panel is Dutch or
Anglo-Dutch. The derivative character runs through
the whole gamut from the reticent and well-balanced
panel period to the "all over" phase, when every inch
was covered with marquetry, to the arabesque and
intricate mosaic work reminiscent of Persia, and
finally to the decadent period when Eastern carpets
found themselves reproduced in marquetry on the
clock-case.</p>

</div>

<p>When the hood of the clock-case became arched
and the dial correspondingly had a lunette, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
decorative marquetry panel in the case below followed
the same form. It is possible, indeed very
probable, that many such shaped panels were imported
and were especially intended to meet the
demand for use on clock-cases. It is always possible
to a trained eye to see whether a panel has
been made to fit the place in which one finds it. Is
it part of a sanely conceived decorative scheme, or
was it used because it happened to be handy as part
of a cabinet-maker's stock-in-trade? We illustrate
two examples of marquetry chests of drawers of the
William and Mary period which offer many interesting
features. In regard to the example with the
oval panels (illustrated p. <a href="#i_092.jpg">93</a>), the side of the piece
exhibits a panel that is incongruous where it is. It
is a clock-case panel. Similarly in the "all-over"
marquetry chest of drawers of the same period
(illustrated p. <a href="#i_094.jpg">95</a>), the panel at the side is undoubtedly
a clock-case panel. To examine both
these chests of drawers in detail is to discover that
the former shows that the panels of the drawers were
carefully thought out before execution. The metal
drop-handles in the centre were each intended to be
there. They were in the cabinet-maker's mind when
he made his design and laid his marquetry. He has
accommodated his pattern to receive these handles.
In the other example it is seen that no such care was
taken. The escutcheon of the locks covers a portion
of the marquetry. The cabinet-maker in London
had his Dutch-imported panels ready to hand and
he used them as he found them.</p>

<p>If some collector or expert were to come along and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
determine that all the green and purple and flecked
glass of the Early Victorian period, bottles with
long necks and gilded stoppers, in English leather
cases, vases of inimitable colour but execrable form,
were typically English as representing early nineteenth
century glass, we should put his theories
aside as nonsense. Partly because we happen to
know what Bohemia was exporting and partly
because we know what the English glassworkers
were doing in the same period. But in regard to
1650 to 1700 it is less easy to determine whether
a wonderful school of expert marquetry-workers
existed in London as a secret industry. One must
assume that they had quietly assimilated all the
technique of the Dutch craftsmen, and descended
on the town, just at the right moment, with a new
art, quite un-English, just at that moment when
Dutch fashions were in the ascendant and when
Mary, the consort of William of Orange, was employing
Marot, the late Surveyor of The Hague, to
convert Hampton Court from a Tudor into an
Anglo-Orange palace.</p>

<p>On an examination of delft earthenware of the
period and Dutch decorative art in general, it is
fairly obvious that the art impulses coincide with
the various phases of ornament as found on the
marquetry panel, whether they were the floriated
designs of Italy with the vase and the symmetrical
flowers in conventional form, further conventionalized
by the Dutch, who clung to tulips and carnations, or
the arabesque designs derived from the Dutch traffic
with the East Indies, the pseudo-Persian sherbet tray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
as a panel, the prayer rug as a full design. With his
black delft to imitate lacquered work of Japan and
his blue delft to imitate the Kang-he Chinese porcelain,
the Dutchman proved himself a superlative
translator. The Dutch East India Company, till
it was supplanted, was the conduit-pipe through
which the arts of the East were allowed to pass
into Europe.</p>

<p>In another portion of this volume we show how
apparently obscure ornament has a long lineage,
and that craftsmen in minor details were producing
something of which possibly they knew not the
origin nor the significance; but it behoves the intelligent
collector, who, after all, is in possession of
more facts, spread over a wider area, to arrive at sane
conclusions in regard to workers who wrought better
than they thought.</p>

<p><b>The Wall-paper Period.</b>&mdash;It was a sad time when
the idea originated to make wall-paper simulate
marble or tapestry or leather, or anything else.
Wall-hangings made of paper by the Chinese came
into England in the early seventeenth century.
But European wall-paper is a modern abomination.
Chintz has a better excuse to imitate satin. "Callicoes"
were tabooed at first, but they had and have a
legitimate place. Wall-paper is an affectation which
cannot be defended. It always pretends to be what
it is not. It is really wonderful that amateurs did
not paste it over clock-cases. Perhaps they did, and
other persons, wiser in their generation, removed it.</p>

<p>But if wall-paper of the late seventeenth and
early eighteenth centuries was not affixed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
clock-case, it was there in spirit, as it was on strident
bureaus and other equally offensive articles of the
period. The "all-over" style exhibits marquetry
run mad. Artisans could apply the thin veneer,
ten sheets to the inch, like paper, and they did.
They had borders as common as modern factory-made
imitation lace at a few pence per yard, and
they laid them beside the pilasters and around the
already well covered case. There was no square
inch that could be said to be free from the attentions
of the gluer of marquetry sheets. He began
to dominate decoration till happily he was extinguished.</p>

<p><b>The Incongruities of Marquetry.</b>&mdash;To those who have
handled a good many examples of marquetry
furniture in which panelling is predominant, such
as clock-cases, there is one feature which always
strikes the practised eye. The question arises, How
did the marquetry panel come there? It is another
way of expressing the view that the proportion is
radically wrong. A glance at a poor panel of a
clock-case, or a faked panel, or a stupidly wrought
panel, is enough. To the collector of old books
nothing is more annoying than to find that the
binder with all his fine tooling has trimmed off the
margins of the printed matter and the illustrations.
It is an edition with the space expurgated. It is
the binder <i>versus</i> the printer, and similarly in the
clock-case it is too often the cabinet-maker <i>versus</i>
the designer of the marquetry panel. This is the
sentiment one has on looking at many of the
marquetry clock-cases. The persons who received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
them from Holland did not always know how to
use them correctly. They either cut off their edges
or left so little space as to convey the idea of a
curtailed edition of the original. In the case of the
panelled period, when there were three panels, two
of them had more often than not to be cut off in
the middle to make room for the circular aperture
in the door showing the swinging pendulum. When
the case-maker received his panels according to
order from the Continent, one would have thought
he would have done away with the hole in the
case. But perhaps the clockmaker insisted otherwise.
At any rate, it is a point showing the absence
of intimate relationship between clockmaker and
case-maker. Holland seems to be the answer, in
spite of all experts to the contrary.</p>

<p>On the "all-over" marquetry clock-cases there is
a decided inclination to follow the designs found on
contemporary delft ware. As to repetition, however
well joined they are, the glue and the wax cannot
hide the poverty of design. Twice or thrice in one
case are patterns repeated. It is the wall-paper
artist at work in a smaller area. In this connection
one recalls the decadence of the wood-engravers,
where three or four artists worked on portions of
one picture cut into sections and screwed together
as one block. The old journals, the <i>Illustrated
London News</i>, and the <i>Graphic</i> and others of the
early 'eighties, tell of this decadence. The thin white
lines, as long as ink and paper last, record this
subterfuge. It was the last note of wood-engraving.
Similarly, in marquetry, when we find the almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
invisible lines denoting several hands, or the piecing
together of the same design cunningly to deceive
the persons at the period, we at a later stage read
this as the note determining the end, and the end
soon came.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE LONG-CASE CLOCK&mdash;THE PERIOD OF LACQUER</p>

<div class="chapsum">
What is lac?&mdash;Its early introduction into this country&mdash;"The
Chinese taste"&mdash;Colour versus form&mdash;Peculiarities
of the lacquered clock-case&mdash;The
English school&mdash;English amateur imitators&mdash;Painted
furniture not lacquered work&mdash;The inn clock.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Lacquered</span> work is the most un-English style of
decoration that has ever been employed by the
cabinet-maker in the embellishment of his furniture.
It came from the East and was introduced into
this country about the same period as tea-drinking.
At first tea was drunk by fashionable folk from cups
without handles, now it is the national beverage.
Lac is a natural product of China, the sap of a
tree in appearance resembling our ash-tree. It is
not an artificial compound of resin and oils, worked
down by turpentine. This natural gum is refined
and coloured red, black, golden yellow, green, or
grey. The surface of the wood is carefully prepared,
and a ground is laid on by degrees, care being taken
that each is of the right temperature and perfectly
hard and dry before any layer is applied. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
less than three and sometimes as many as eighteen
thin layers are thus applied to the surface of the
wood before the actual decoration of this ground
by the artist commences. In regard to the use of
lac in this country, practical experts have questioned
as to whether it is possible in a climate like this
to effect the clean drying so necessary to attain
perfection. London and other cities, on account of
their dust-charged atmosphere, are unsuited for
lacquer work.</p>

<p>The artist draws his design of landscape or figures
or birds or flowers, filling his details with gold or
silver and superimposed colours built up with mastic,
of those parts which are intended to be in slight
relief.</p>

<p>The Japanese brought the art of lacquer to the
highest perfection. To those readers who desire to
see the art of lacquer shown in its various stages,
there is in the Botanical Museum at Kew Gardens
a collection of specimens in various stages, including
sections of the lacquer-tree, from which the lac
exudes, and of various coloured lacs, and examples
illustrating no less than fifty different methods of
lacquering sword-sheaths.</p>

<p>An examination of lacquer work is to be found in
<i>Chinese Art</i>, vol. i, by Dr. Stephen W. Bushell, formerly
physician to His Majesty's Legation at Peking.
In the print-room of the Imperial Library at Paris
is an album with drawings of the processes and
explanatory notes.</p>

<p>The Lacquer Industry in Japan forms a Report
of His Majesty's Acting-Consul at Hakodate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
(Mr. J. J. Quin), printed as a Parliamentary Paper
in 1882.</p>

<p><b>Its Early Introduction into this Country.</b>&mdash;At first
the Portuguese had the monopoly of trade with the
Far East. When Philip of Spain annexed Portugal
in 1598, he sought to shut out the Dutch traders from
participation in this trade. By this act he laid the
foundation of the Dutch East India Company. It
was only when Cornelius Houtman procured some
Portuguese charts that the Dutch navigators first
rounded the Cape <i>en route</i> for India and China and
Japan. The great Dutch East India Company was
established in 1602.</p>

<p>Porcelain and lacquered cabinets and boxes were
thus at an early date distributed as rare articles of
curious art at the beginning of the seventeenth century.
Drake and Raleigh had captured Spanish
galleons with such treasure, and the Portuguese
possession of Goa in India had brought the wealth
of the Far East to Western Europe. Evelyn tells us
in his <i>Diary</i>, in 1681, of the richness of the apartments
of the Duchess of Portsmouth at Whitehall.
"The very furniture of the chimney was massy silver.
The sideboards were piled with richly wrought plate.
In the niches stood cabinets, the masterpieces of
Japanese art." The dowry of Queen Catherine of
Braganza did not come up to the expectations
of the spendthrift Charles, although she came
loaded with "japanned" boxes and rare artistic
treasures from the East. Memoirs of this time
furnish abundant proof that lacquered work was, in
pieces of imported furniture, known in this country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
But it is little likely that anything of that nature was
manufactured here at that date. As a nation we
had not developed on those lines; it is a fact worth
remembering that as late as the reign of Charles II
the greater part of the iron used in this country
was imported from abroad.</p>

<p><b>"The Chinese Taste."</b>&mdash;This is a term which finds
itself repeated like a parrot-cry from the late years
of the seventeenth century. The vogue reached
its height in 1750 as a fashion for the wealthy
and a pastime for the dilettanti, and disturbed the
steady growth of national spirit in art. There was
a Chinese Festival at Drury Lane Theatre in 1755.</p>

<p>Chippendale snatched his fretwork in his brackets
and the angles of his chairs from the Chinese worker
in ebony. He erected pagoda-like structures on his
cabinets. The Bow china factory termed itself "New
Canton," Worcester copied Chinese models, Bristol
carried on the story. Staffordshire with her earthenware
brought out the "willow-pattern," and a hundred
other designs were acclimatized as reflections of the
blue and white Canton porcelain.</p>

<p>"Taste is at present the darling idol of the polite
world and the world of letters, and, indeed, seems
to be considered as the quintessence of almost all the
arts and sciences. The fine ladies and gentlemen
dress with taste, the architects, whether Gothic or
Chinese, build with taste." So writes the essayist
in the <i>Connoisseur</i> journal in 1756, and he continues
ironically, "Whoever makes a pagoda of his parlour
fits up his house entirely in taste."</p>

<p>This "Chinese taste" had seized France and Holland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
The French artist-craftsmen readily saw that
the great influx of Chinese and Japanese furniture
would stifle their national artistic impulses. Louis
Quatorze had to issue a decree at the end of the
seventeenth century to prohibit the import of
Oriental wares. The craze reached England later
and developed later. But early in the eighteenth
century the cabinet-makers of London petitioned
Parliament against the importation of manufactured
articles from the East Indies to this country. But
nothing much seems to have come of their protest.
The East India Company had become too powerful
to brook interference with its trade by interested
artisans. Thousands of lac panels were brought
over in the company's ships, even in spite of the
deep-rooted belief that lacquer work had at that
time become an English art. It is to be presumed
that some of the contentions of the old European
lacquer-workers may be said to be parallel with the
assertions of old potters who asseverated that they
had discovered the true porcelain of China. In 1709
B√∂ttger, at Meissen, had for the first time succeeded
in producing white hard, paste porcelain, not in imitation
of the Chinese, but actually a reproduction of
the Oriental technique. But the secret was well kept,
and B√∂ttger and his workmen were imprisoned in
a fortress. Since Father Du Halde, the Jesuit, had
published in Paris in 1725 his <i>Description de l'Empire
de la Chine</i>, other European potters had endeavoured
to find the natural earths of the Chinese, kaolin and
petuntse. When William Cookworthy, the chemist
and potter of Plymouth, wrote of his discovery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the china clays, Josiah Wedgwood journeyed to
Cornwall on a wild-goose chase.</p>

<p>It may be imagined, with data such as these to
guide us&mdash;first, the growing intensity of the "Chinese
taste"; second, the demand for furniture and porcelain
on the part of the wealthy classes&mdash;that as a
consequence an attempt was made to supply the
demand.</p>

<p>There were various sources of supply for lacquered
furniture, especially lacquered clock-cases. There
was the Dutch market, from which was obtained,
as in the case of marquetry, panels of lacquered
work. At first, without doubt, these came from the
East through Holland. The next stage was the
Dutch lacquered panel actually produced in Holland.
Later there was again the Oriental panel
coming straight from the East through our own
East India Company. Contemporaneously with
these importations, which served as models, there
was the lacquered work produced in this country.
We shall later attempt to differentiate between
these styles.</p>

<p><b>Colour versus Form.</b>&mdash;In various epochs the struggle
has gone on in the applied arts in regard to the use
and abuse of colour in decoration as an adjunct. In
furniture the pendulum has swung to and fro. Colour
follows form in the process of evolution. In England
there is the oak period and the walnut period, where
the beauty is solely dependent upon form. The
conception of the cabinet-maker has usually been
confined to form, eschewing colour, or to colour more
or less ignoring the beauty of form, or as a compromise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
when form has been subservient to colour.
When form and colour are in exact harmony the
highest ideals are reached in furniture. The Chinese
have reached these ideals. The Italian school of the
fifteenth century in the marriage coffer, where painting
or coloured intarsia is of parallel beauty with the
rich carving, achieved like success. With similar
judgment, in holding the balance evenly between
form and colour, Andr√© Charles Boulle conceived
his wonderful work in tortoiseshell and brass and
ebony and silver, forming a brilliant marquetry of
colour, the colour effect being further heightened
with a reddish-brown and sometimes a bluish-green
ground beneath the semi-transparent tortoiseshell.
Riesener and David Roentgen, in equally masterful
technique, produced marquetry of tulip-wood, holly,
rosewood, purple wood, and laburnum. With the
style embodying the enrichment of the plain surface
with colour came the use, and later the abuse,
of lacquered panels.</p>

<p>A Dutch cabinet-maker, Huygens, had won renown
by reproducing remarkable imitations of the Japanese
lacquered panel. In Holland, Chinese prototypes
had served as models for delft ware. The Dutch
potter had simulated the appearance of blue and
white Chinese porcelain, but his results were obtained
by a white enamel covering a brown body. Dutch
lacquer work is similarly imitative of the results
rather than a duplication of the Oriental processes.
Chintzes and printed "callicoes" equally are surprising
efforts at simulation, if not dissimulation.</p>

<p>As a supreme effort of the successful attempt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the European to reproduce the wonderful limpid
transparency of the old Chinese and Japanese work,
the secret of Sieur Simon Etienne Martin, a French
carriage painter, stands supreme. His varnish, called
after him <i>Vernis-Martin</i>, has become the term, as
in the case of Boulle, for a certain class of technique.
In 1744 he obtained the monopoly in France for the
manufacture of lacquered work in the Oriental style.
He obtained the ground of wavy golden network,
such as in rare Japanese panels, and on this Boucher
and other artists painted Arcadian subjects.</p>

<p>In England it cannot be said that these great
foreign styles have been emulated in the grand
manner or even attempted. When colour came to
England it came straight from Holland, and <i>le style
r√©fugi√©</i> is responsible for the intermingling of the
Dutch and French styles, though the former were
at first greatly predominant. The important bureaus
and splendid lacquered cabinets produced in the
period when colour was employed so lavishly as to
disregard form, are attributable, not for the least
part of their excellent technique in the skilful employment
of lacquer, to the great number of French
and other foreign workmen who had settled in this
country.</p>

<p><b>Peculiarities of the Lacquered Clock-case.</b>&mdash;The use
of the lacquered panel in the long case of the clock
cannot be said to have a definite period of its own.
We cannot mark an exact date when marquetry
panels or marquetry "all-over" cases were no longer
the vogue, and when lacquered cases succeeded
them. The two styles were comparatively contemporaneous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Marquetry cases, as we have seen, are
as early as 1680, and they continued till about 1725,
and later in the provinces. The lacquered case may
be said to have run its day from about 1700 to 1755.
On the whole they seemed to have had a longer
vogue, mainly on account of the prevalence of the
"Chinese taste," which demanded colour. Lacquered
decoration jumped the experimental stage of reserves
or panels that apparently were not quite in exact
proportions to the case, but had to be fitted in and
sometimes trimmed. It came at a juncture when
this difficulty had been mastered. Accordingly, we
find the whole of the lacquered case has been regarded
as a rectangular surface to be decorated, and we have
not met with any instance of more than one lacquered
panel being employed on the case. The marquetry
case offered other features which indicated the
struggle of colour for supremacy. In the early
marquetry specimens the turned walnut pillars of
the hood belong to an earlier style. They indicate
that that form had not been completely ousted.
The marquetry worker in the end overcame this and
drove these pillars out. In the lacquered case no
such struggle is visible. The case is entirely a
scheme in colour. It is red, or green, it is black
and gold, but the design is never so strong as to
tempt one to examine its form. It is simply decorative,
but much in the manner that, in textile art,
tapestry is pleasing, not challenging a critical examination
of form, but suggesting a somnolent
restfulness.</p>

<p>Touches of incongruity appear in later examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of the lacquered clock-case when the arched hood
came into fashion and the panel followed suit. It
is a shape unsuited to an Oriental design. Such a
Western architectural style used in combination with
so Eastern a technique as lacquered work is like
putting a Corinthian pillar on a Japanese bronze.</p>

<p>The lacquered cases illustrated in this chapter
indicate the style. The example with the movement
by Joseph Dudds (1766-82), (illustrated p. <a href="#i_114.jpg">115</a>),
shows the early attempt to simulate the Eastern
style. It is poor and thin, and has not stood the
ravages of time and a damp climate.</p>

<p>The specimen (illustrated p. <a href="#i_116.jpg">117</a>), with the movement
by Kenneth Maclellan (1760-80), is of more
grandiose character. The panelled door was probably
an importation, and the other decorations in
lacquer done in this country.</p>

<p>Among the Scottish clocks, the Patrick Gordon
example (1705-15), (illustrated p. <a href="#i_262.jpg">263</a>), proves this
usage of imported Oriental panel with added
decoration in as near a style as could be done on
the spot. In this example the remainder of the
so-called lacquered decoration is stencilled.</p>

<p><b>The English School.</b>&mdash;Dutch lacquered work was
as prevalent between 1680 and 1725 as was Dutch
marquetry. The rivalry between "John Company"
and the Dutch traders was one factor that has to be
considered. Lacquered work was coming straight from
the East to Amsterdam and to English ports. What
was not absorbed by the Dutch burghers came to
England. Apart from this competitive Oriental
trade, there was the lacquered work actually made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
in Holland. In examining the state of that country
at this time one meets with a surprise. It was a
land teeming with colour. Dutch painters have
taught us to think otherwise. The Rijks Museum
exhibits the prevalent styles of the seventeenth
century. Here we find leather decorations derivative
from Spain in rich gilding, Louis Quatorze boudoirs
with classic gods and goddesses. The "Chinese
Boudoir" from the palace of the Stadtholder at
Leeuwarden shows the intense love of colour that
had conquered Holland in the late seventeenth
century. Here we find the Chinese prototypes in
porcelain which provided the potters at Delft with
problems to solve, and lacquered work which suggested
patient imitation by Dutch cabinet-makers,
but the colour and advanced technique of such
Oriental originals must have confounded the old
craftsmen.</p>

<p>The potter simulated the porcelain with his
enamelled earthenware, the cabinet-maker produced
lacquered work which passed muster in Holland
and England. Take the house of the rich burgher.
The table was covered with an Eastern rug, called
a "table carpet." The linen cupboards so beloved
by the Dutch were surmounted by Chinese and
Japanese porcelain. Often a Japanese lac cabinet
gave another touch of colour to the interior. Rich
damask curtains, Spanish leather hangings, Oriental
rugs, finely inlaid cabinets of ebony and silver, and
a glowing array of copper and brass, filled the heart
of the Dutch <i>vrouw</i> with pride. Such rooms were
regarded as a "holy of holies," and the family had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
their meals in the kitchen or living room and were
warned off the show room. The seventeenth-century
Dutchwoman, according to all accounts, seems to have
been a shrew. But enough is extant to prove that
Holland was artistically, in regard to the home-life
of Stadtholder and burgher, resplendent with colour,
in spite of the low tones of the canvases of Dutch
painters.</p>

<p>In England, too, the love of colour was becoming
predominant. Fifty thousand Huguenot families,
with their Latin blood and love of colour, scattered
in the Protestant countries had no inconsiderable
influence. Spitalfields silk is as English as the
dark and tortuous lanes from which it emanates.
But every weaver had a French name, and although
the industry has come to an end, tomorrow, if the
demand arose, the descendants of these French
Huguenots would again stand at the looms to
produce English silk.</p>

<p>The sudden outburst of colour in the now rarely
prized English lacquered cabinets and bureaus must
be attributed to the foreign workmen in our midst
at the close of the seventeenth century. It is
English perforce, because it was made in England.
The followers of Huygens the Dutchman and the
disciples of Martin the Frenchman were capable of
producing something new and something surprising
in English cabinet work. The foreign quarters of
London have always been the centre of art
industry. Armenians sit on the roofs of fashionable
West End emporiums and restore carpets and
rugs. Polish and Russian furriers travel by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Tube from Whitechapel and Bethnal Green, from
the Commercial Road and Shoreditch to Regent
Street and Bond Street with their handiwork. What
is now, was two hundred and fifty years ago. Alien
craftsmen, more skilled than the English workmen,
worked for less wages and produced better work.</p>

<p>The English style, therefore, of the late seventeenth
century in lacquered work was as English as the
work of Daniel Marot the Frenchman and of Grinling
Gibbons the Dutch woodcarver at Hampton
Court.</p>

<p>The English style is praised as something fine
and original as a European replica of the Oriental.
So it is. It is the French grafted on to the Dutch
and acclimatized here. It holds the same place in
lacquered work as the Dutch delft ware does in
ceramics. It is a splendid imitation of a technique
not grasped by the imitator. Lovers of lacquered
rarities and collectors of the so-called English style,
so rare and so much extolled, can take it to heart
that it is really English&mdash;as English as the canvases
of Vandyck or the painted panels of pergolesi.</p>

<p><b>English Amateur Imitators.</b>&mdash;There are records
enough to show that the art of lacquer had appealed
to the amateur on account of its apparent simplicity.
It is ludicrous to read of the attempts of seventeenth-century
teachers of the art of "japanning" to young
ladies. The seventeenth-century "miss," according to
old memoirs, left her Stuart stump needlework, with
its quaint costume and crude figures, to simulate
the subtle art of the Chinese or Japanese lacquer-worker.
At that time the greatest coach-panel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
painter could not have approached the finesse of the
lacquered work coming from the East. In spite of
Stalker and Parker in 1688, with their treatise how to
produce lacquered "japanning" in the Oriental style&mdash;a
guide for amateurs and the standard work for
all the academies that taught this new accomplishment&mdash;we
cannot believe much of this amateur work
found its way on clock-cases, which in point of
time heralded the oncoming burst of colour. It
is incredible that all of a sudden, following the
clock-case and the chair-back, fine red and green
and black and gold lac decoration, as exhibited
by rich cabinets and gorgeous bureaus scintillating
with colour, could have succeeded the stump-work
amateurs. Stalker and company must go by the
board as caterers for a very amateur taste. Their
book possibly never reached the trade, or if it did,
it could have had very little influence upon adept
refugees practising a subtle art.</p>

<p><b>Painted Furniture not Lacquered Work.</b>&mdash;Whatever
may be determined as to the merits of <i>Vernis-Martin</i>
or of the creations of Huygens the Dutchman in
regard to comparison with Chinese and Japanese
prototypes, it is certain that English amateur work,
which is often dull gold design on a black ground,
is not only an echo but a feeble echo of the original.
They are splendid examples of dulness. Pepys
complains that women wore feathers in his day.
The feminine instinct is difficult to reckon with.
Some years ago very up-to-date young wives
"aspinalled" everything pea-green or peacock-blue.
They did a lot of damage. Similarly, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
seventeenth century, when the boudoir escaped from
needlework into lacquer, much otherwise harmless
furniture must have been spoilt. Hundreds of fine
pieces of furniture were brought up to date by the
simple process of painting them and simulating the
Chinese lacquered work. In the Early Victorian age
of graining, sapient workmen painted solid oak
panels and grained them to resemble the oak that
they had painted. Folly is not the monopoly of
any age. It is eternal. To-day the framer, if he
is not watched and carefully instructed, glues a
fine engraving to a sheet of cardboard and rubs a
wet cloth over the surface of the print, destroying
its beauty for ever with his clod-like smudge. Fools
are ever present to confound the conservation of
art treasures.</p>

<p>Painting a surface, however Oriental it may be
in design, is <i>not</i> lacquer work. Half the so-called
lacquered work is merely painting with a coat of
varnish put on it. When Sheraton and his school
brought French painted panels into fashion in this
country, they brought a true art. But it was not
lacquer. Cipriani, Angelica Kauffmann, and Pergolesi,
who used their brushes on cabinet work, and Zoffany,
who did not disdain to paint clock-cases for
Rimbault, brought a new style to this country. It
was the age of colour-prints in the French taste; the
Wards, the George Morlands, and the Bartolozzis
demanded colour as a suitable environment. Satinwood
and coloured marquetry and the painted panel
accordingly found a place at this moment.</p>

<p>The amateur attempts of the late seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and eighteenth centuries, up to the <i>furore</i> of the
"Chinese taste" in 1750, must be disregarded as
something outside the field of the collector&mdash;that
is, if he is desirous of selecting lacquered work of
excellent character. As a phase of fashionable
caprice it is no doubt interesting, but it is to be hoped
that most of these amateur efforts have succumbed
to the influence of time and have been destroyed.
They represent nothing in particular except a sham
imitation of a great art, as stupidly offensive as
was Strawberry Hill, the Gothic toy of Horace
Walpole.</p>


<p><b>The Inn Clock.</b>&mdash;We interpolate here a short outline
of a class of clocks which appeals to collectors.
In America they are termed "banjo clocks." A
good deal has been written about them, connecting
them with Pitt's tax on clocks and watches in
1797 of five shillings on each clock per annum, which
Act was repealed in the next year. It is supposed
that these clocks suddenly came into being when
private clocks were taxed, and were used in inns.
Owing to such a deep-seated belief they are always
known throughout the country as "Act of Parliament"
clocks. But they were used earlier than the
Act of 1797, and were probably ordinary inn clocks
in common use about that time. They were wall
clocks varnished with black lacquer, mostly plain,
but sometimes decorated in gold. Often the figures
were in white and they had no protective glass.</p>

<p>The example illustrated (p. <a href="#i_124.jpg">125</a>) is decorated in

is John Grant, Fleet Street, about 1785. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
rather an elaborate specimen, as most of the ordinary
inn clocks of this shape are innocent of these rather
elaborate lacquer enrichments. They are to be
found all over the country; we have seen one in
an inn at Evesham. They are in Kent and the
south, but do not appear to have been in common
use in the northern counties, unless imported there
later. Ale-house jests are frequent on old earthenware
mugs&mdash;"Drink faire, don't swear"&mdash;and broad
hints as to credit. This is similarly found as a
standing pointed jest in an "Act of Parliament"
clock in a Kentish inn, minus the works, with the
inscription "No Tick"&mdash;a jest which the most
seasoned toper could readily understand.</p>

<p>Oliver Goldsmith, when he wrote his <i>Deserted
Village</i> in 1770, is said to have described in "Sweet
Auburn" a typical Irish village in regard to its
desertion, but he introduced touches reminiscent of
his town habits. When he wrote of the village
ale-house:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">The whitewash'd wall, the nicely sanded floor,</div>
      <div class="verse">The varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>he may have been thinking of inn clocks he had
seen in Fleet Street. By his use of the word
"varnished" it would appear that Goldsmith had
in mind the ale-house clock of which we are
speaking. There was no other that was "varnished,"
that is, lacquered. The term "Act of Parliament"
clocks must therefore be discarded; these clocks were
common inn clocks, and had nothing to do with
the Act levying the tax in 1797.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>As a rule, elaborately lacquered examples of such
clocks should be regarded with caution by the
collector. The inn clock was "varnished," but it had
no panelled lacquer and lattice-work gold ornament.
It was a simple hanging wall clock <i>sans</i> artistic
embellishment.</p>

<p class="center">THE LONG-CASE CLOCK&mdash;THE GEORGIAN PERIOD</p>

<p class="chapsum">
The stability of the "grandfather" clock&mdash;The burr-walnut
period&mdash;Thomas Chippendale&mdash;The mahogany
period&mdash;Innovations of form&mdash;The Sheraton
style&mdash;Marquetry again employed in decoration.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> collectors and connoisseurs the most desirable
period of the long-case clock is from 1700 to about
1720. As we have seen in the previous chapters, this
embraces the two styles of marquetry and lacquered
work, although lacquered work continued to the
middle of the eighteenth century. The year 1720
is not an arbitrary date, but this year is a convenient
one. It marks the accession of the first of the
Four Georges and the advent of the House of
Hanover. As the title to a period of time, the
Georgian period is as good as any other. Just
a hundred years afterwards George III died, and
the Fourth George reigned only ten years, till
1830.</p>

<p>In regard to the clock-case, the century was not
filled with great changes. The writers of memoirs
of the time&mdash;Selwyn and Walpole, Lord Hervey and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Fanny Burney&mdash;furnish many sidelights on the
Georgian period. Thackeray in his <i>Four Georges</i>
illuminated the Georgian era with more vigour than
Early Victorians could stand. The eighteenth century
is repellent by its stupidity and coarseness, by its
insipidity and dulness, and yet it is relieved by a
continuity of extraordinary forcefulness and freshness
of vigour, undimmed in our naval and military
history, unequalled in our art and letters. The
following names occur to prove this suggestion:
Clive and Warren Hastings, Rodney and Nelson,
Moore and Wellington, Reynolds and Gainsborough,
Dr. Johnson and Burke.</p>

<p>We lost, but not for ever, the love of the American
Colonies for the great Mother Country, whose tongue
is a common heritage, and whose democratic freedom
is akin to that across the Atlantic, and this
through the obstinacy of a German monarch thwarting
the will of the people. "The first and second
Georges were not Englishmen, and therefore were
not popular, and excited no enthusiasm in their
subjects, but were simply tolerated as being better
than the Popish Stuarts"; so says Lord Macaulay
in his <i>Essay on Chatham</i>. It is ludicrous to learn
that Walpole, beefy Englishman that he was, spoke
no French, and had, as George I spoke no English,
to conduct State affairs in Latin. What a stratum
of misunderstanding on which to rest a people's
destinies!</p>

<p><b>The Stability of the "Grandfather" Clock.</b>&mdash;The
long-case clock had become a piece of furniture.
It was of marquetry decoration, in keeping with contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
tables and cabinets, or it was lacquered
in rich colours in "Chinese taste" to keep touch
with the Oriental parlours. But concurrent with
the age of marquetry and lacquer was the great
walnut period. The delightful veneer of burr-walnut
in Queen Anne days in cabinets and chests of drawers
and other important pieces of furniture did not
neglect the clock-case. The gnarled figure of the
walnut was essentially a proper decoration to apply
to the clock-case.</p>

<p>The long-case clock had not only become acclimatized,
but it had become thoroughly English.
The simplicity of its construction, and its proud
record as a perfect timekeeper, gave it the supremacy
over all other clocks. English clockmakers, with
the fine sense of practical utility which governed
their employment of mechanism, had reached a point
when further inventions became more of scientific
use than popular. The "grandfather" clock has
no equal within its limits. It runs for eight days.
Its construction is so simple that when needing
repair it need not be sent to a specialist. It has
no delicate parts to confound the provincial maker.
Hence it has lasted two centuries and more as a
standard English clock. There is, too, a certain
lovableness about the "grandfather" clock. The
popular term suggests this. It is the heritage
of the poor. The "grandfather" clock of the
yeomanry has passed down through many generations.
Indeed, the love of it as an article of
furniture has, in many instances, endowed it with
a value far greater than it possesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Burr-walnut Period.</b>&mdash;Veneer had become an
established technique. Woods with fine figure
served as panels laid on wood of lesser rarity
or decorative importance. Oak was a good
foundation for walnut veneer. Earlier, as we have
seen, walnut was laid as a ground on oak and the
marquetry design laid on the walnut. But in the
burr-walnut period carefully selected walnut sheets
were employed to decorate surfaces of bureaus and
clock-cases. The age of walnut is synonymous with
the days of Hogarth.</p>

<p>Burr-walnut clock-cases are not so frequently
found as could be wished. The burr-walnut panels
are marked in a series of knot-like rings, obtained
from the gnarled roots of the walnut-tree. The
peculiar pleasing effect of this and other mottled
walnut is heightened by the mellow effect time
always gives to these walnut examples, which cannot
be produced with any appreciable success by modern
imitators.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Chippendale&mdash;The Mahogany Period.</b>&mdash;There
is no doubt that the name of Thomas Chippendale
will always be representative of the mahogany period
of English furniture. But there were other makers
contemporary with him who did splendid work. The
Chippendales, Thomas the father and Thomas the
son, picture-frame carver and cabinet-maker at
Worcester, migrated together to London in 1729.
The son, Thomas, published his <i>Director</i> in 1754.
He was the leading cabinet-maker and designer of
his day, and his day lasted till about 1780, when
his son, Thomas Chippendale the third entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
into partnership with Haig, and the firm became
Chippendale and Haig, who also in turn produced
magnificent work. Close upon the heels of the
Chippendales was the firm of Hepplewhite. The
brothers Adam, architectural designers and creators
of furniture suitable for its new classic environment,
began to make their impress upon interior decoration
and on furniture, as they had upon Princes Street,
Edinburgh, the Quays at Dublin, and the Adelphi
in London, with their patent stucco mouldings and
festoons.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the student must bear in mind these
great movements taking place during the second half
of our Georgian period, viz. from about 1740 to the
year 1791, at which date appeared the first edition of
Sheraton's <i>Cabinet Maker and Upholsterers Drawing
Book</i>, to herald another style, blended with the Adam,
but departing from it at important points. In
examining clock-cases of this prolific and restless
period, it should be of exceptional interest to the
connoisseur to show how unnamed cabinet-makers
in London and in the provinces attempted to employ,
with varying degrees of skill, the designs promulgated

and construction in cabinet work.</p>

<p><b>Innovations of Form.</b>&mdash;As exemplifying the variations
of the mahogany period clock-case, we illustrate
several types showing reflections of the great
impulses that were in the air. The clock, illustrated
(p. <a href="#i_238.jpg">239</a>), has a case of Spanish mahogany with fine
figure. The hood is enriched with fretwork, and
with elegantly moulded door, and the superstructure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
as a pediment exhibits the Chinese style. The
terminals are mahogany. The dial shows phases
of the moon, and the movement is by a provincial
maker, E. Cockey, Warminster.</p>

<p>Of the year 1770 is another mahogany clock with
handsomely carved frieze and elaborate terminals.
The love for architectural ornament is seen in the
hood, and in the pillars on the waist below on each
side of the panelled door. The base is decorated
with a panel, in mahogany of fine figure. The
feet are beginning to become more pronounced.
The movement of this is by Henderson, of London,
and its height is 9 feet (illustrated p. <a href="#i_132.jpg">133</a>).</p>

<p>Another clock, by Thomas Wagstaff, in date about
1780, exhibits a less grandiose appearance. The
height is less, being only 8 feet 2 inches. The
pediment of the hood reverts to types which are
often found decorated with lacquer work, and the
brass terminals are of similar character to those of
an earlier period. It is noticeable that the base
continues to show increased ornament in the feet,
with an added scroll (illustrated p. <a href="#i_136.jpg">137</a>).</p>

<p>As showing another type of clock with magnificent
decoration we illustrate (p. <a href="#i_142.jpg">143</a>) the hood of a
long-case musical clock, attributed to Rimbault,
who was especially noteworthy for his musical
movements, and his cases were decorated by Zoffany.
An examination of this shows the detailed character
of the painted work. It is Italian in conception, and
quite in keeping with other work of Zoffany.</p>

<p>Another illustration (p. <a href="#i_138.jpg">139</a>) shows the typical
classical style. The case was designed by Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Adam, and is in date about 1775. The dial becomes
circular, and owes certain of its decoration to French
form, although it is surmounted by a Greek urn, but
the flying garlands betray it. The waist becomes
tapered, terminating in a base of graceful proportions
and reticent ornament. The fluted work and
the scroll indicate the design of the architect. One
can imagine such a chaste clock finding itself in the
cold, un-English environment of Ken Wood, or on
the staircase of some learned society, with candelabra
of bronze of classic design, with hoofs as feet and
with the Roman lamp throwing out its modern
flame. The movement of this clock is by Stephen
Rimbault, of Great St. Andrew Street, about 1775.</p>

<p>Another example of a clock by James Hatton,
London (about 1810), exhibits several new features.
Its case is of rich feathered mahogany, inlaid in the
Sheraton manner with satinwood shells, banding,
and herring-bone stringing. The hood is massive
and reverts to an earlier period, and the ornament
of the base, in brickwork style, was known to have
been employed by Chippendale. The finials are
brass. The dial is brass, and in the lunette are
painted a ship and a cottage (illustrated p. <a href="#i_144.jpg">145</a>).</p>

<p>For the continuation of these styles one must turn
to the provincial makers (Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">VIII</a>), showing a
variety of decoration and touches of incongruity in
style and anachronism in date&mdash;a glorious intermingling
of contemporary with bygone features,
affording unequalled delight to the collector. In
the case of provincial made furniture, whole districts
carried on fashions for a quarter of a century or longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
after they had been forgotten in London, and the
clock-case is no exception.</p>

<p>Included in this period is the fine clock (illustrated
p. <a href="#i_148a.jpg">149</a>) by Robert Molyneux and Sons, London,
1825, now in the Bristol Museum. It has one
main dial recording minutes, and two smaller dials
showing hours and seconds respectively. The main
dial has two hands, which indicate Greenwich mean
time and Bristol time. The type is known as a
"regulator" clock, with the twenty-four-hour dial
and other additions appertaining to the astronomical
clock. The illustration shows the time to be:
Greenwich, 11.42 (i.e. 42 minutes past 11 o'clock);
Bristol, 11.32 (i.e. 10 minutes difference). The
clock has a mercury pendulum. There was a
somewhat similar clock constructed by Dell, of
Bristol.</p>

<p class="center">THE EVOLUTION OF THE LONG-CASE CLOCK</p>

<p class="chapsum">
Its inception&mdash;Its Dutch origin&mdash;The changing forms
of the hood, the waist, and the base&mdash;The dial and
its character&mdash;The ornamentation of the spandrel&mdash;The
evolution of the hands.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> 1680 to 1850 is a long period of time for a
particular style of timepiece to run without interruption
or without displacement by any other fashion.
It may naturally be supposed that during this period
changes have occurred in form, in decoration, and in a
score of minor details delightful to the collector and
interesting to the student of form in design. The
inception of the long case was due to the common
use of the seconds pendulum. This required a
certain space to swing in, and the pendulum was of
a certain length. This undue length does not seem
to have been necessary in the wall clock of the
so-called "Act of Parliament" type, and as Lord
Grimthorpe, the constructor of "Big Ben" at Westminster,
says: "Spring clocks are generally resorted
to for the purpose of saving length; for as clocks
are generally made in England, it is impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
make a weight clock capable of going a week, without
either a case nearly 4 feet high, or else the
weights so heavy as to produce a great friction on
the arbour of the great wheel. But this arises from
nothing but the heaviness of the wheels and the
badness of the pinions used in most English clocks,
as is amply proved by the fact that the American
and Austrian clocks go a week with smaller
weights and much less fall than English ones, and
the American ones with no assistance from fine
workmanship for the purpose of diminishing friction,
as they are remarkable for their want of what is
called 'finish' in the machinery, on which so much
time and money is wasted in English clock-work."</p>

<p><b>Its Dutch Origin.</b>&mdash;As we have before explained,
the marquetry case came straight from Holland.
Our "grandfather" was a Dutchman, as far as clock-cases
go. The Dutchman Huygens is credited with
having been the first to employ the pendulum in
the mechanism of the clock. Leonardo da Vinci,
that stupendous genius, left notes as to his study
of the pendulum (1452-1520), and Galileo came
with his later studies (1564-1642). It is a disputed
point as to when and where the pendulum came into
being. We must accept Huygens (1629-95) as the
practical exponent of the pendulum, although not the
original discoverer of its properties. But at any
rate, the long-case clock may be generally accepted
as coincident with the use of the long or seconds
pendulum. And to Holland we must look for this
habitual usage of the long wooden case to protect
the weights and the pendulum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the designs of Marot there are drawings
of long-case clocks certainly more ornate than those
usually associated with such an early period (this
was about 1660 to 1680), and French Louis XIV and
Louis XV tall clocks are built on these lines, and
Chippendale at a later period found Marot an
exceedingly prolific master of design to study.</p>

<p><b>The Changing Forms of the Hood, the Waist, and
the Base.</b>&mdash;The evolution of form in one class of
object from one period to another is of exceptional
interest. In furniture, in china, in glass, and in
silver, the progression of forms is so marked as to
give practically a date to each piece. The gate-leg
table can be traced from three to twelve legs with
double gates. The chair, from its straight oaken
back and massive arms to the tapering legs and
curves of the satinwood period, runs through stages
as definitely marked as though the makers had
signed the pieces. Now the stretcher is low, next
it becomes higher, then it disappears altogether; or
the splats in the back are single, then double, with
cane panels, and then again upholstered. The top
rail of the chair affords similar delectation to the
connoisseur of form changing for a definite reason.</p>

<p>The clock-case underwent equal changes in
character, not only in its decoration, as we have
seen, in marquetry, in lacquer, and in veneers of
burr-walnut and mahogany, but its proportions
varied. At first, coming as it did in the walnut
period, the hood had turned rails, in keeping with
the turned rails of the chairs of the time. The
hood was square and small, the waist was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
slender, and the base in proportion. During the
marquetry and the lacquered periods the hood
began to grow larger and more dominant. It had
a domed superstructure, and the finials or metal
terminals were more ornamental and grew in
number (see illustrations, pp. <a href="#i_132.jpg">133</a>, <a href="#i_116.jpg">117</a>). The massive
character of the early mahogany period, culminating
with Chippendale, had its effect on the long
clock-case. The hood had a pagoda-like edifice in
the Chinese style (see illustration, p. <a href="#i_238.jpg">239</a>), or it had
the woodcarver's adoption of architecture, as in the
crest of the hood (see illustrations, pp. <a href="#i_144.jpg">145</a>, <a href="#i_116.jpg">117</a>).
The rail in the hood had become a Corinthian
pillar, and later a pilaster. At the end of the
eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century
it had a new form: when it was turned mahogany
it stood away from the case, as an ornament apart,
rather than a supporting pillar (see illustration,
p. <a href="#i_232.jpg">233</a>). This is a noticeable feature in country-made
clocks of this period.</p>

<p>At first there was no door in the case. But on
the introduction of the door, its panelled form
commenced to make its progression in form in
accompaniment with the other features of the case.
It was square, in simple forms, with square hoods.
In 1730 it took the form somewhat similar to the
shape of the lowest marquetry panel, as shown in
the clock by Jas. Leicester (see <a href="#i_005.jpg">Frontispiece</a>). It
really follows the chair-backs of a period of some
ten or fifteen years' prior date. It is an instance of
the clock-case slightly lagging behind contemporary
furniture design. The shapes of these panels resemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the chair-backs of the James II, William
and Mary, and the Queen Anne period. In some instances
the simple form becomes taller, terminating
in a small semicircle. The Sussex iron fire-backs of
the seventeenth century show similar forms of panel.</p>

<p>By 1770 the panel had lost its lunette or semi-circular
form at top, and in outline resembled a
Chippendale chair-back. The evolution is easily
traceable. A similar fashion is observed in tombstones
in old country churchyards. By the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, especially
in certain North of England type clock-cases,
notably Lancashire and Cheshire, these panels are
Gothic in character (see illustration, p. <a href="#i_230.jpg">231</a>). Following
French fashion, in some late examples there is
a glass panel (see illustration, p. <a href="#i_274.jpg">275</a>).</p>

<p>The base undergoes certain changes, though in a
lesser degree. Sometimes plain, sometimes with a
plinth, sometimes with feet. Dutch long clock-cases
have great wooden balls as feet. In the
Chippendale period the plinth has a suggestion of
Chinese character. In later types the feet are more
pronounced, and the base has an ornamental panel
in the Sheraton period with a delicate marquetry
inlay of simple character. In Sheraton's <i>Design Book</i>
there are two clocks showing the base further ornamented
by turned pillars similar to the hood.</p>

<p>The growing importance of these feet and their
frequent use, especially in ornate examples, are
shown in the specimens illustrated (pp. <a href="#i_132.jpg">133</a>, <a href="#i_136.jpg">137</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Dial and its Character.</b>&mdash;When only one
hand was in use, it was obviously not necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
denote the minutes. Later, the minutes were
engraved on the dial to meet the use of the
minute hand; sometimes these were in a circle
inside the hour numerals, and later they were put
on the outer edge, outside the hour numerals.
The hour numerals are almost invariably of Roman
style, and the figure IV has by universal custom
been engraved IIII, though there are examples of
a late period with IV which are of country make.
Similarly, Arabic figures have also been used.
The illustration of a fine dial, of eighteenth century
period, showing the various phases of the iron
industry at Ashburnham, in Sussex, has these
figures; this is a country-made clock (p. <a href="#i_242a.jpg">243</a>).</p>

<p>The dials were brass, and the hour numerals
appeared on a circle of brass plated with silver.
Iron dials were used later, in the decadent
period, and both numerals and floral designs were
painted on the enamelled surface in lieu of
engraved and ornamental metal-work, and often
a landscape or figure subject occupied the
lunette.</p>

<p>The lunette form followed the square face, and
sometimes the maker put his name in this lunette,
and later below the centre of the clock, and later
again not at all on the dial. The lunette form no
doubt determined the shape of the panel of the
door in the case below, to which we have previously
alluded. The illustration (p. <a href="#i_158a.jpg">159</a>) shows these
forms. The dial, by Henry Massy (1680), has the
name between the numerals VI and VII. The
lunette form in a dial by John Draper (1703) has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the name of the maker in a circular disc above the
hour circle.</p>

<p>Enlargements of the Henry Massy dial and of
another by John Bushman show the character of
engraving and the position of the maker's name
(illustrated p. <a href="#i_162a.jpg">163</a>).</p>

<p>In regard to the engraving put on the dials of
these old clocks, it is not impossible that William
Hogarth, when he was an apprentice at Master Ellis
Gamble's shop, at the sign of the "Golden Angel"
in Cranbourn Street, Leicester Fields, did some of
this work. We know that Thomas Bewick engraved
clock dials when an apprentice at Newcastle-upon-Tyne
(see p. <a href="#Page_215">215</a>).</p>

<p>The last form of the long-case dial is circular,
an unusual type in vogue during the closing decades
of the eighteenth century, belonging to the classic
and French styles and in no way diverting the
fashion of the main stream of case-makers.</p>

<p>Concerning the use of glass for the protection
of the dial in the long-case clock, it was in use
in coaches for the first time in 1667. According
to Pepys' <i>Diary</i> we learn: "Another pretty thing
was my Lady Ashly's speaking of the bad qualities
of the glass coaches, among others the flying open
of the doors upon any great shake; but another,
my Lady Peterborough, being in her glass coach
with the glass up, and seeing a lady pass by in a
coach whom she would salute, the glass was so
clear that she thought it had been open, and so
ran her head through the glass."</p>

<p>At first the hood of the clock lifted off and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
glass was fixed; later the glass was framed in a
door, and subsequently the hood slid off, which
fashion is found in all but the earliest examples.</p>

<p>The term "dial" is a survival of the word "sundial."
Like all innovations, there may have been
those who preferred the old character, or it may
have been left to Charles Lamb, lover of past and
faded memories, to ruminate on garden gods in
the Temple: "What an antique air had the now
almost effaced sundials, with their moral inscriptions,
seeming coevals with that Time which they
measured, and to take their revelations of its flight
immediately from heaven, holding correspondence
with the fountain of light.... The shepherd,
'carved it out quaintly in the sun,' and turning
philosopher by the very occupation, provided it
with mottoes more touching than tombstones."
Elia, Shakespearean scholar that he was, could not
have forgotten the melancholy Jaques with his:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is not probable that the "fool i' the forest"
drew from his pocket a sundial; it was, no doubt,
a pocket-clock, or, in other words, a watch.</p>

<p>The art of dial-making is a subtle one. It is
true that some are pleasing in their balance and
others are displeasing, which sets us wondering what
rules there are to govern the symmetrical arrangement
of circles and figures and their co-related
hands. There is an air of solemn grandeur about
a fine dial; its dignity is as unruffled as the march
of Time itself. The old masters of dial construction
had the art of spacing as completely under control
as had Caxton the great typographer in the balance
of his printed page.</p>

<p>What Lord Grimthorpe has said<a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a>
<a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> about the dials
of turret clocks applies in its principles to the dials
of domestic clocks. "The figures are generally
made much too large. People have a pattern dial
painted; and if the figures are not as long as one-third
of the radius, and therefore occupying, with
the minutes, about two-thirds of the area of the dial,
they fancy they are not large enough to be read
at a distance; whereas the fact is, the more the
dial is occupied by figures, the less distinct they
are, and the more difficult it is to distinguish the
position of the hands, which is what people want
to see, and not to read the figures, which may very
well be replaced by twelve large spots.... The
rule which has been adopted, after various experiments,
as the best for the proportions of the dial
is this: Divide the radius into three, and leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
inner two-thirds clear and flat, and of some colour
forming a strong contrast to the colour of the
hands&mdash;black or dark blue if they are gilt, and
white if they are black. The figures, if there are
any, should occupy the next two-thirds of the
remaining third, and the minutes be set in the
remainder near the edge."</p>

<p><b>The Ornamentation of the Spandrel.</b>&mdash;There are
some interesting types of ornamentation of the
space between the hour circle and the square outlines
of the dial. The neat filling of spandrels
offered problems to the architect and woodworker
long before the clockmaker found similar difficulties.
It is not easy exactly to fill a triangle with a design
that is pleasing. Some of the best examples are
found in Italian lettering, old sixteenth-century
woodcuts of the letter L.</p>

<p>In English clocks, the spandrel in the lantern
clock about 1670 had a plain cherub head, as
simple in character as the fine pearwood carving
from a Buckinghamshire church we illustrate of a
slightly earlier period, still rich with unimpaired
colour (p. <a href="#i_166a.jpg">167</a>). German clocks had this device
of the cherub's head, but not in the spandrel. At
the British Museum there is one example with
this cherub-head as a base ornament at the foot of
the clock, which rests on it. This is in date 1600.</p>

<p>The design of the cherub with outspread wings
was common enough in Italy, where children have
served as models since Donatello. It became established
as a form and was a favourite embellishment
of the English stone-carver in the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
century. Horace Walpole protested at its abuse
by the contemporaries of Christopher Wren, and
it can be found outside St. Paul's Cathedral and
in many other London churches and over late
Stuart doorways.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, nothing new; it was a pleasing
spandrel ornament which appealed to the clockmaker
as suitable to clock dials. It naturally
received floriated additions, and both in its simpler
form and in this later and more elaborate variation
it appears on the spandrels of clock dials (see p. <a href="#i_166b.jpg">167</a>).</p>

<p>It is interesting to find the clockmaker so conservative.
Once the cherub found its way on to
clocks, there it remained. It is in the clock at
Windsor Castle which Henry VIII gave to Anne
Boleyn, formerly at Strawberry Hill before Queen
Victoria purchased it. In its first form on the
spandrel it practically followed the simple woodcarver's
design we illustrate, but with this difference:
the triangle to be filled by the clockmaker in his
spandrels, at each of the four corners of his dial,
was exactly opposite to that of the woodcarver
or the stone-carver where he made a bracket. The
triangle in these cases stood on its apex. The clockmaker's
triangle stood on its base. Hence it will
be observed that a straight line drawn along the
head of the cherub (p. <a href="#i_166a.jpg">167</a>) finds itself level with
the top of the two wings. The clockmaker modified
this in his metal spandrel ornaments. He dropped
the wings, so that the top of the cherub's head is
the apex of the triangle and the tips of the two
wings the base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Later, the head, although still retained, was enveloped
in floriated ornament and the cherub became
unrecognizable. But the triangle is well filled.</p>

<p>We next come to a most interesting stage, coincident
in time with the rebuilding of Hampton Court.
The "Glorious Revolution" had become established
and James II sent packing. The two cherubs holding
up the Protestant crown would seem by its
prevalence at this period to be a sort of symbolic
record of events that were happening. Huguenot
and Dutch metal-workers put their thoughts into
form, and we find this William and Mary Protestant
emblem on the clock-face (see p. <a href="#i_170a.jpg">171</a>).</p>

<p>But we also find it on the stretcher of the walnut
chair of the period (as illustrated, p. <a href="#i_170a.jpg">171</a>). Nor is this
all. Lambeth and Bristol delft dishes contribute
their p√¶an in honour of the House of Orange.
On some a crown is found, with the date 1690,
the sole decoration of a plate some 9 inches in
diameter. On others a crown is shown on a cushion,
with the sceptre and orb beside it. These are all
contemporary with other English delft dishes bearing
crudely painted portraits of William and Mary
crowned.</p>

<p>Cardinal Wolsey's coat of arms, as shown at
Hampton Court, was two cherubs supporting a
cardinal's hat. One can imagine that Queen Mary,
backed by little Christopher Wren, brought Daniel
Marot and Grinling Gibbons to put an end to all
this. Accordingly, if one pays a pilgrimage to
Hampton Court one sees the carved angels triumphantly
holding up the Protestant crown to supplant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Wolsey's former insignia of arrogant splendour
under the old religion.</p>

  <div class="caption">BRASS SPANDREL OF DIAL OF CLOCK.<br />
    Showing design of angels supporting crown.</div>
</div>

<p>In regard to the long continuance of this design,
it is interesting to observe that it appears in plates
attributed to the Lowestoft factory. As a matter
of fact, such plates were made in Holland to the
order of some shipmaster. They usually celebrate
the wedding of some persons in the district, whose
names are still known. They are decorated in
blue, and have two cherubs supporting a heart,
over which is a crown. There is one dated 1755,
inscribed "Henry and Mary Quinton, Yarmouth,
Norfolk." Its Dutch origin is proven by the orthography
with the two dots over the letters <i>y</i>, and
the misplacing of other letters: "Henr√ø and Mar√ø
Quinton, Yarmouth, nor ff: olk. 1755."</p>

<p>After the two cherubs on the clock spandrel came
further floriated designs minus the cherub's head.
This, later, disappeared, and the spandrel had only
a matted surface, in contrast to the rest of the dial.
This in turn disappeared when the dial departed
from its former glory of a silvered hour circle and
became a sheet of iron painted according to taste.
We give examples of this&mdash;the Sussex dial depicting
the iron works (p. <a href="#i_242b.jpg">243</a>) and the provincial style
with the lunette painted with a figure subject
(p. <a href="#i_248b.jpg">249</a>). The end of the story is the china dial
of the painted Hindeloopen Dutch clocks beloved
of our childhood, with weights and chains and
other pleasing mechanism. Here the nineteenth century
Dutch clock joins hands with the old wall
clock of the seventeenth century, Dame Fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
having pirouetted round the dial, trifling with all
collectors in "the whirligig of time."</p>

<p><b>The Evolution of the Hands.</b>&mdash;The early examples
of the long-case clock or of the lantern clock with
one hand show a fine rich design in metal-work
in the hand itself. It was brass, often gilded, or
iron wrought with great skill and beauty. At the
advent of the minute hand it was made in character
with its fellow. At first the dial had a <i>fleur-de-lis</i>,
and later a slightly more floriated use of
this emblem on the hour circle between each hour.
In old examples the hand, when it came opposite
this decoration, was in keeping with the <i>fleur-de-lis</i>
as though it were part of the design of the hand.
It is only a fancy, but, as no design comes by
accident, it is very probable that such was the idea
of the old dial engraver.</p>

<p>The study of hands is exceptionally interesting;
they run through a regular series of styles, as varied
as the ornamentation of the cases. Some of the
designs are of exquisite balance as specimens of
delicate metal-work, in which the English have
always been proficient. Their character can be
gauged by the expert clockmaker or connoisseur
to such a nicety that it can be seen at once if the
clock has its original hands or not. Those of my
readers who wish to pursue this subject will find
the hands adequately treated and well illustrated
in <i>English Domestic Clocks</i>, by Mr. Herbert Cesinsky
and Mr. Malcolm R. Webster, a volume which no
student of clocks should fail to consult as a practical
and authoritative work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to hands, it is curious that the fashion
of placing a minute hand to travel around the dial
with the hour hand has established a method of
reckoning time in a popular manner not in accordance
with scientific exactitude. The eye glances
at the dial and sees that the minute hand has so
many minutes to travel <i>before</i> reaching the next
hour. We accordingly say, for instance, it is twenty
minutes to four or ten minutes to four. On one half
of the dial we have acted quite scientifically in saying
it is ten minutes past three or half-past three, but
the moment the point of the half hour is reached
we act in a different manner. We never speak or
think of four thirty-five, four forty, or four fifty,
unless we have to consult the railway time-table.</p>

<p>This all comes about by reason of the minute
hand being placed as it is. In clocks with the
minute hand having a separate dial of its own no
such unscientific error would have arisen. The
second hand in such clocks travels around the dial
and points outside the hour numerals.</p>

<p class="center">THE BRACKET CLOCK</p>

<p class="chapsum">
The term "bracket clock" a misnomer&mdash;The great
series of English table or mantel clocks&mdash;The evolution
of styles&mdash;Their competition with French
elaboration.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Long-case</span> clocks came into being when the long
or "royal" pendulum required protection by having
a wooden case. It was possible to have a short
pendulum, and clocks intended for table use had
a short pendulum. The long pendulum swings
exactly in a second, and for it to do this it must
be of a certain length, determined by physical laws
followed according to mechanical formul√¶ by the
scientific clockmaker, too complex to be given here
in detail. It may be interesting to record that the
length of a seconds pendulum&mdash;that is, one requiring
one second to move from extreme to extreme&mdash;is
39.1398 inches in the latitude of Greenwich and
is of different lengths in differing latitudes.</p>

<p><b>The Term "Bracket Clock" a Misnomer.</b>&mdash;In the
old form of clock&mdash;the brass lantern type, weight-driven&mdash;it
is obvious that when the weights and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
chains were suspended below the case the clock
could not stand on a table. Such clocks had to
hang on a wall, as so many old engravings show,
or they were placed on a bracket against a wall,
with the weights hanging beneath. With the
advent of the pendulum new theories were in the
air. At its first use as a short pendulum it was
placed in front of the dial. When the seconds
pendulum was recognized as a scientific regulator,
the length precluded clocks in which it was employed
being used as table clocks. It was a distinct departure
from miniature timepieces as decorative
domestic ornaments. Scientific it undoubtedly was,
and as such it commenced a new development in
the direction of astronomical clocks and scientific
regulators of time. The table clock had to pursue
another course. It belongs to another school of
mechanism. The weight-driven clock strove to
arrive at exactitude and scientific accuracy. The
other clock, like the watch, attempted economy of
space in conjunction with the maximum of exactitude
such economy would allow. It essayed to fulfil
certain conditions. It was easily portable, it could
stand on a table, or more often on the mantelpiece,
a place it can almost claim as its own in the English
home by tradition. The watch with similar aims
taxed the art of the maker to enable it to be
easily carried on the person. These two classes of
timepiece, the portable clock and more readily
portable watch, were spring-driven. The development
of this mechanical principle, running parallel
with the evolution of the weight-driven clock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
arrived at great scientific accuracy, as exemplified
by the nautical chronometer and by the modern
machine-made watch, whose timekeeping qualities
are remarkable. In fact, it may be said that the
table or portable clock and the watch together
have dethroned the weight-driven clock as a
domestic clock.</p>

<p><b>The Great Series of English Table or Mantel Clocks.</b>&mdash;To
the beginner the appearance of an old table
clock has not the same enticement as a brass
lantern clock with its obvious claim to pre-modern
form. It may even be said that the tyro clings
reverently to his worship of the "grandfather" clock
as something sacred. With their steady, uninterrupted
progress from the middle seventeenth
century for two hundred years, it is remarkable
how conservative these table clocks have been to
a comparatively fixed form. They stand in solidarity
of workmanship and perfection of mechanical
detail as exhibiting the superlative character of
English clockmaking. During that period, in long
procession, generation after generation, they have
upheld the dignity of the science of horology as
practised by English clockmakers, whose craftsmanship
and perfection of exact detail deservedly won
a reputation on the Continent and in America. An
English clock of the finest period holds few
superiors and very few equals in the world for
reliability and exactitude. "<i>Bajo la palabra de un
Ingl√©s</i>" (On the word of an Englishman) is a proverbial
saying in the Spanish States of South
America, and such an honourable appellation can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
equally be applied to the said Englishman's clock,
upon which great clockmakers have proudly inscribed
their names as guarantee of its fidelity and truth.</p>

<p>From Thomas Tompion in the days of Charles
II to Benjamin Vulliamy in the days of George IV
the series has been unbroken. We find table clocks
by all the leading makers of long-case clocks, so
that whatever competition lay between the principles
of the one and the principles of the other
was confined to the workshop of the clockmaker
who set himself to master the intricacies of two
styles. It was a friendly rivalry which is found
to exist in other fields of human action. Disraeli
the politician wrote novels; Macaulay the historian
published verse; Seymour Haden laid down his
lancet as a doctor to take up the etching-needle to
become one of the greatest modern etchers.</p>

<p><b>The Evolution of Styles.</b>&mdash;In the examples illustrated,
the slow progression of types slightly differing
from each other is readily seen. The late
seventeenth century exhibits types of reticent form,
with ebonized case, and having a brass basket-top
decoration surmounted by a handle showing
its use as a portable clock. This handle is retained
in the carriage clock of to-day&mdash;a clock which finds a
prototype in the carriage clock of Marie Antoinette.
In height these clocks were about 12 inches and in
width about 9 inches. At this period brass oblong
ornaments were affixed to the case, a detail which
disappeared with the next later type.</p>

<p>The clock on the left (illustrated p. <a href="#i_180a.jpg">181</a>) is by Sam
Watson, of Coventry, and is dated 1687. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the basket top, reminiscent in decorative treatment
of the metal fret found in lantern brass clocks of
contemporary date. It will be observed that these
clocks have two hands. The spandrels of this and
the adjacent clock have the single cherub's-head
brass ornament. The latter clock, on the right, is
by Joseph Knibb, of Oxford, and is in date 1690.
The basket decoration is absent and the top is
of simpler form. These two examples indicate
that fine work was done in the provinces. By
the end of the reign of William III the table
clock had grown taller. The example illustrated
(p. <a href="#i_182a.jpg">183</a>), by Thomas Loomes, is 15&frac12; inches high and
11&frac12; inches wide. It will be noticed that the basket
top was still being made, and from now onwards
the four turned brass terminals at the top became
a feature and lasted for a century. By the first
quarter of the eighteenth century a lunette had been
added, as shown in the clock on the same page by
Thomas Johnson, in date 1730. From this date feet
were almost always employed. Similar feet embellished
the long clock-case from a slightly later
period throughout the century, and are still in
evidence in examples made as late as the first half
of the nineteenth century. In the 1730 clock by
Thomas Johnson, the only brass ornament on the
case is the escutcheon to the lock, a feature which,
as time went on, lost its prominence and became
more reticent.</p>

<p>In the reign of George II the clock again grew
in stature. Its portability was evidently not a
necessity. It cannot be now said to resemble a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
carriage clock. Chamber clocks became definite
objects of decorative utility as part of the domestic
fitments of a room. The architectural ornament
becomes pronounced, and there is a massive grandeur
about the cases which suited the early Georgian
mansions and Hogarthian furniture of the period.
These eight-day striking and alarum clocks had
become a feature of the English home. The fine
provincial example by John Page, of Ipswich, is
24 inches high and 12&frac14; inches wide. In addition to
the four terminals there is a fifth at the apex on
a column with supporting metal ornament. The
adjacent clock by Godfrey Poy, in date 1745, has
at the apex a small figure of Ajax. In both these
examples there are rings at the side as ornaments,
or possibly for use to lift the clock in lieu
of the older style of the handle at the top (p. <a href="#i_186a.jpg">187</a>).</p>

<p>In the reign of George III (1760-1820) the table
clock shows greater variety. It was a restless time,
filled with wars and political struggles&mdash;a reign
notable for the American Declaration of Independence
on 4th July 1776, for the beginning of the
French Revolution in 1789, for the "darkest hour
in English history," the planned invasion of England
by French and Spanish fleets, and contemplated invasion
of Ireland by the Dutch fleet. In this reign,
too, there came what may be termed the industrial
revolution due to the introduction of machinery
and steam-power. The growing wealth of the
middle classes demanded more luxurious furniture.
Merchants and manufacturers, shipowners and traders
with India and the East, Lancashire cotton-spinners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and mill-owners founded a new plutocracy. Bristol
and Liverpool traders in "blackbirds," as the iniquitous
slave trade was impiously termed, amassed
fortunes. Although Pitt advocated the emancipation
of slaves, under his rule "the English slave trade
more than doubled."</p>

Early nineteenth century. The cottager's desire to possess a mantel clock satisfied.<br />
(<i>In collection of author.</i>)</p>

<p>Two George III clocks, in date 1760, by Johnson
and by Thomas Hill, are illustrated (p. <a href="#i_188a.jpg">189</a>). One
shows the recurrence of an old form with the handle
at the top of the case, having only as a new feature
delicate brackets&mdash;a female bust, suggesting in miniature
the figure-head of some Indiaman. It is a
pleasant ornament one would like to have seen more
often adopted. The adjacent clock, by Thomas
Hill, evidently derives its design from France, and
is a forerunner, in its departure from the square
case, of the style which Sheraton, in his adaptation
from the French, made at a later date.</p>

<p><b>Competition with French Elaboration.</b>&mdash;During the
latter decades of the eighteenth and the opening
years of the nineteenth centuries, the influx of French
fashions had a considerable influence on the furniture
designers of this country. What Chippendale
had commenced, Sheraton continued, each according
to his point of view. So great was the effect that
there is actually an English Empire period entirely
dependent on the classic interpretation of the French
school. To treat of French clocks would occupy
a space that is denied in this outline study of
English work. But that they are of paramount
importance cannot be denied. The French craftsman,
as he always did, realized the possibilities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
his subject. His cases are elaborate and imaginative
in conception. His fertility of invention is remarkable.
On the whole it must be admitted that the
case is the weakest part of the English clock. The
case-maker never quite realized his opportunities.
He might have done so much better. There is a
stability and solid, almost stolid, soberness that
might have been lightened, so one thinks at times.
But on the other hand, when the Frenchman is bad
in design, his exuberance of ornament and headstrong
imagination seem too lurid for a sober clock
which only records ordinary time.</p>

<p>This French influence was world-wide. By the
courtesy of the authorities of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, New York, an American clock is
illustrated (p. <a href="#i_192.jpg">193</a>), the makers being Savin and Dyer,
of Boston. This is in date 1780 to 1800. It is of
fine proportions, and the lyre ornament is kept in
due reticence.</p>

<p>As exemplifying the far-reaching effect that
French design had on this country, we reproduce
an interesting illustration of a cottager's clock of
the early nineteenth century (p. <a href="#i_194a.jpg">195</a>). It is really
a vase of earthenware made in Staffordshire. On
one side is painted in blue a Chinese scene, on the
other is a clock-face in imitation of a French dial.
But the hands perpetually mark seventeen minutes
past eight. In copper lustre-ware this vase with
its sham dial served the cottager as something
ornamental, although not useful. It is a replica in
homely English earthenware of French <i>finesse</i>, a
cottage echo of the vase-clocks of S√®vres in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
apartments at Versailles. The cottager's desire
to have a clock was satisfied by the Staffordshire
potter.</p>

<p>Many clocks of the last quarter of the eighteenth
century show the lingering styles of the earlier
decades. It is impossible to lay down any definite
rule in furniture, in silver, or in old clocks, that in
such a year a certain style ends. Approximately,
one may determine periods and by close application
discover slight indications of new styles beginning
to take the town. Now and again one comes across
examples a great many years behind the time,
especially in provincial makers, where fashions in
cases were not so frequently changed.</p>

<p>Illustrated on p. <a href="#i_198a.jpg">199</a> are two clocks; one, in
date 1770, by Alexander Cumming, is only 14 inches
in height; the other, 1800, having no maker's name,
is 15&frac34; inches high. A new and very pleasing form
is introduced. We see the dial in process of losing
its lunette. It makes its ascent on the case to take
its place as in later styles. This raising of the dial
affected the top of the case, which became of circular
form. The transitional period is shown by the
ornament remaining in the right-hand clock in the
lower spandrels. The case-maker had not quite
assimilated the changing form. It is interesting
to note that in both these clocks the handles of
the early portable clock are reintroduced.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century
the circular dial had become established. An
interesting transitional clock by Barraud (p. <a href="#i_200a.jpg">201</a>), in
date 1805, shows that the case-maker was averse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
parting with the lunette. He accordingly places
the dial in the centre of the case and has a crescent-shaped
ornament, with a design adapted by the
metal-worker from the Chinese potter. Of the same
date is a provincial clock by Strowbridge, of Dawlish.
Here the maker has boldly adopted the circular
top, and the result is a case of pleasing proportions.</p>

<p>Restlessness of design characterized this period.
The old square dial was rarely if ever used. The
arched-top case is another form, as illustrated (p. <a href="#i_204a.jpg">205</a>),
where the maker, Biddell, refrained from following
the line of the circular dial in his case. The adjacent
example, in date 1800 to 1815, shows the circular
dial surmounting the pediment of the case. After
its vicissitudes it has at length triumphed in becoming
the dominant note in the design.</p>

<p>As illustrating the varied attempts to make the
table clock an imposing ornament and deal with
its decoration in an elaborate manner, the fine clock
in ebony case inlaid with blue and white Wedgwood
medallions is a remarkable example (illustrated p. <a href="#i_206.jpg">207</a>).
An especially noteworthy feature in this
clock is the beaded ornamentation around the dial
and the medallions and the other portions of the case
of cut steel.</p>

<p>The series of table clocks illustrated should
indicate to the reader the salient features of such
clocks, which are sought after by collectors and
carefully prized by those who love the fine work
of the old English clockmakers.</p>

<p class="center">PROVINCIAL CLOCKS</p>

<p class="chapsum">Their character&mdash;Names of clockmakers found on clocks
in the provinces&mdash;The North of England: Newcastle-upon-
Tyne&mdash;Yorkshire clockmakers: Halifax
and the district&mdash;Liverpool and the district&mdash;The
Midlands&mdash;The Home Counties&mdash;The West Country&mdash;Miscellaneous
makers.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> deal of attention has been paid by
collectors to clocks by well-known London makers
and too little examination has been given to fine
examples by those of the provinces. In the present
chapter an attempt is made to fill a hiatus in this
respect, and by the kindness of those interested in
the various localities certain data are presented
which may stimulate the student to continue his
researches on the lines here indicated.</p>

<p>The metropolis attracted noteworthy makers, but
they had their origin and often their early training
in the provinces.</p>

<p>The following are among the great London clockmakers,
but they were not Londoners. They come
from all parts of the country. Joseph Knibb (about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
1670) was an Oxfordshire man. The famous
Thomas Tompion, born in 1638, came from Bedfordshire.
George Graham (1673-1751) tramped to
London from Cumberland. Thomas Earnshaw, who
perfected the marine chronometer, his additions being
still in use, was born at Ashton-under-Lyne in 1750
and served his apprenticeship there. Henry Jones,
who was the pupil of Edward East, was the son of a
vicar at Southampton. Charles II had a clock made
by him. Thomas Mudge was the son of a schoolmaster
and was born at Exeter in 1715. Another
Exeter man was Jacob Lovelace, who took over
thirty years to construct a remarkable clock. The
celebrated John Harrison was the son of a carpenter
on an estate at Pontefract. It was he who competed
for the Government gratuity offered for a nautical
timekeeper, for which he finally received ¬£10,000,
after repeated tests in voyages to the West Indies
by himself and his son. We think of his early
struggles, when he travelled up to London after he
was forty, only to find that he had to return to the
provinces and continue his vocation as clock-mender
in ordinary and inventor extraordinary. There is a
long-case clock with wooden wheels and pinions by
him in the Guildhall Museum, London.</p>

<p>The list is by no means complete. There was
John Ellicott, who was born at Bodmin, and another
Cornishman from the same town is John Arnold,
who was apprenticed to his father, a watchmaker
there. Arnold continued what Harrison had begun
in the chronometer. We must not exclude the great
Dr. Hooke, who was born at Freshwater, Isle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Wight, who invented the anchor escapement for
clocks and contested the invention of the balance
spring in watches with Huygens.</p>

<p><b>Names of Clockmakers found on Clocks in the
Provinces.</b>&mdash;It has been suggested that in some
cases the name of a local maker does not necessarily
determine, when found on the dial or
elsewhere, that such clock has been made by the
person whose name it bears. It has also been
advanced that the name of the owner was sometimes
put on the dial. This last theory can be
dismissed as being of so infrequent use as to be
practically negligible in recording lists of makers.
The other conjecture may possibly have sufficient
truth in it to disconcert collectors of examples of
local crafts. Of course, it is a statement that cannot
be proved, nor can it be disproved. Presumably
a clockmaker in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, when clockmaking was something more
than selling or mending clocks that other people
made, did not deliberately set up business and, in
a small town where secrecy was impossible, make a
practice of putting his name on work he did not
execute. That he did not make all the parts himself
is admitted. Had he done so, he would have
had to be a chain-maker or a catgut-maker, a pulley-maker,
a chaser of metal for his dials, a cabinet-maker
for his cases, and so on down to his most
minute screws. One might as well take similar
objection to Sir Joshua Reynolds or Gainsborough
that they did not extract their pigments from the
natural vegetables or minerals, that they neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to become proficient in manipulating hogs' bristles
or camel-hair into brushes, or that they could not
and did not make their own canvases or carve their
own frames.</p>

<p>It did happen that an old clock by one maker
was sent to another for repair, and he made such
extensive repairs to the movement that he felt himself
justified in putting his own name to the clock
in its new state. The owner would have had something
to say to this interchange of names had there
not been some justification for it. This practice,
however, is not confined to the provinces, and we
cannot charge the provincial maker with being
wholly unscrupulous.</p>

<p>Some purists in collecting have objected to the
presence of a country maker's name stencilled on
the dial, as being evidence it was not his handiwork.
But this is not in itself a crime. It is far more
likely that such a clock is of local make, and that
being in a remote part it was not easy to get anyone
to paint his name on the dial or engrave it.
Had he had it made to order in a town surely his
name would have been painted for him. In a
measure, crudities of this nature and peculiarities
not found in clocks from the great centres are hallmarks
of genuineness.</p>

<p>At the time of the passing of the Act in 1797
relating to the taxation of clocks and watches, the
following places sent representatives to London to
protest against this tax:&mdash;</p>

<p>Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Liverpool, Leicester, Derby,
Bristol, Prescot, Coventry, and Edinburgh. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
these, Prescot (a few miles from Liverpool) and
Coventry represented the watch industry. We may
therefore fairly conclude that the other places
represent the most noteworthy centres of clockmaking
at that period.</p>

<p><b>The North of England: Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</b>&mdash;In
regard to provincial makers, one wonders what
'prentice hands have gone to the making of the long
cases. Did Thomas Chippendale, when he was
working at his father's bench at Worcester, execute
any of his early joinery and carving to embellish
now forgotten clocks? Who can say? At Newcastle-upon-Tyne
we are on surer foundation, for
it is on record that Thomas Bewick, the wood-engraver,
was apprenticed to Ralph Beilby, an engraver
at Newcastle, on 1st October 1767 for seven years.
His master's business lay in engraving crests and
initials on watch seals, teaspoons, sugar-tongs, and
other pieces of plate, and the numerals and ornaments
on clock dials, together with the maker's
name. Here, then, was young Bewick's 'prentice
work&mdash;the master of white line on the wood block.
Later, Bewick confessed to a friend that when engraving
these clock dials his hands grew as hard
as a blacksmith's, and almost disgusted him with
engraving. At any rate, there is the strong probability
that such Newcastle dials engraved by Thomas
Bewick are on clocks of the date from 1763 to
1774.</p>

<p>The following list of names of Newcastle and
other clockmakers in the North of England is
produced by the kindness of C. Leo Reid, Esq., of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and by the permission of the
proprietors of the <i>Newcastle Weekly Chronicle</i>, compiled

<p>In regard to the remarks about Thomas Bewick
and clock dials, there is every likelihood that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
'prentice work in engraving them between 1763 and
1774 is to be found on clocks by S. Boverick,
William Coventry, William Fenton, Gibson, John
Hawthorn, John Wilson, and Christian K. Reid; the
latter maker certainly knew Bewick. The dates
given in the above list do not definitely represent
that the maker's work was confined to that period
exclusively. They are approximate dates.</p>

<p><b>Yorkshire Clockmakers: Halifax and the District.</b>&mdash;We
have already seen that John Harrison, the
great self-taught genius, born in 1683, was a
Yorkshireman. Of early makers there is a record
of John Ogden, of Bowrigg, of the late seventeenth
century, and Samuel Ogden, born at Sowerby in
1669. The name of Ogden is found on many
Yorkshire clocks. Thomas Ogden came to
Halifax; although the Ogdens seem to have been
a Quaker family, one of his clocks is in the Unitarian
Chapel vestry. The Ogden type of dial with
the phases of the moon, although not original, being
adapted from Dutch models, became noteworthy
in the North of England, and such styles were
termed "Halifax" clocks. Samuel Ogden, a descendant,
migrated to Newcastle-upon-Tyne (see list,
p. <a href="#Page_216">216</a>), perpetuating the name a hundred years after.</p>

<p>In Halifax parish churchyard is a tombstone to
the memory of R. Duckworth, clockmaker, 1677.</p>

<p>John Mason was a maker about 1760, and his
father, Timothy Mason, was a clockmaker before
him. At Rotherham some years ago there were
some Mason clocks on exhibition, and there were
eight generations of Masons as clockmakers, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
later branch having settled at Rotherham. Such
is the record of many provincial makers.</p>

<p>Emanuel Hopperton, of Leeds, made clocks with
marquetry cases. One bore the proud motto, <i>Non
mihi sed mundo.</i></p>

<p>Henry Brownhill, of Briggate, Leeds, watchmaker
and clockmaker, was sufficiently prosperous to issue
several tons of halfpenny copper tokens in 1793.
By the courtesy of S. H. Hamer, Esq., of Halifax,
an illustration of one of these tokens is given.</p>

  <div class="caption">HALFPENNY, 1793.</div>
</div>

<p>This was the year when the Reign of Terror
began and when Marie Antoinette was executed.
In England great commercial distress was felt.
Banks issued notes in excess of their capital. Gold
was scarce, and the Bank of England restricted its
issues. A panic ensued and several banks failed.
Pitt issued Exchequer Bills to the extent of five
millions.</p>

<p>Other local clockmakers are Thomas Liston, of
Luddenden, 1718-79, and his son Thomas, of
Halifax, 1745-1815. It is reported that this latter
Thomas Lister travelled by coach from Halifax to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
London to regulate and keep in order the clock at
St. Paul's Cathedral. There is an orrery by him
in the Glasgow University Museum.</p>

<p>William Lister is another member of the same
family who made long-case clocks. In his dials a
noticeable feature is the absence of the hour circle
as being separate from the rest of the plate. The
dial was made in one piece and attached to a back-plate
of brass.</p>

<p>Pattison, another Yorkshire maker, made long-case
clocks similar to those of William Lister.</p>

<p>John Hartley, of Halifax, about 1770, was the
maker of a thirty-hour grandfather clock in oak
case with brass square dial and moon and date
lunettes. Titus Bancroft, of Sowerby Bridge, 1822,
a church-clock maker, also made grandfather clocks.</p>

<p>John Hallifax, of Barnsley, who died in 1750, made
a fine long-case clock now at Wentworth House.</p>

<p>Gilbert Chippindale, of Halifax, 1781, is another
maker of fine clocks. A fine example of his work
is illustrated (p. <a href="#i_218a.jpg">219</a>).</p>

<p>R. Henderson, of Scarborough, early eighteenth
century, is another Yorkshire maker. Richard
Midgley, 1720-40, of Halifax, made a number
of clocks still treasured locally. Samuel Pearson
is known about 1790, and John Stancliffe, of Bark-island,
is another local maker.</p>

<p>Collectors have too frequently associated Yorkshire
clocks with the later periods, with ponderous
cases of gigantic size, but, as is shown, the Yorkshire
makers are worthy of considerable attention by connoisseurs
as having a lineage extending back into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
periods when clockmaking was at its best, and when
the case-maker was not such a preponderating factor
as he seems to have been in the early nineteenth
century days in the North.</p>

<p><b>Liverpool and the District.</b>&mdash;In regard to Liverpool
and the vicinity, at the Tercentenary Historical
Exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery in 1907 a
collection of clocks and watches was made to illustrate
the art of the clockmaker in that part of the
country. By the kindness of George H. Hewitt,
Esq., J.P., who arranged these exhibits, we are
enabled to supply the names of many of the Liverpool
clockmakers.</p>

<p>Peter Litherland patented the rack lever escapement
in 1793-4 which Robert Roskell, the Liverpool
maker, introduced into his watches. At the above
Exhibition was shown a pendulum watch by George
Taylor, about 1700, and one by William Tarleton,
1797, with the Government stamp indicating that the
tax of a guinea had been paid. This was in 1797,
the first and only year when a tax on watches and
clocks was levied. One remembers the fine portrait
of Colonel Tarleton in uniform, with one foot on a
cannon, after the portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds,
signed I. Johnson, on a Liverpool mug. He was the
Member of Parliament for Liverpool from 1790 to
1812. This family gave the name to Tarleton Street,
Liverpool.</p>

<p>That Liverpool and the district was renowned for
its watches is shown by a silver watch made by
Thomas Worsley, Liverpool, inscribed, "Presented
to Robert Burns by his brother ploughmen of Air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
(<i>sic</i>) March 9, 1785." Among other makers at Liverpool
whose names are found on watches are Fair-clough
(about 1800), Edmonds (about 1770), Joseph
Finney (about 1770), Robert Roskell (about 1800),
M. J. Tobias &amp; Co. (1820), Harrington (1790), Peter
Hope (1795), J. Johnson (1796).</p>

</div>

<p>It is possible that some of these makers also made
long-case and other clocks; we find the name of
Roskell on a long-case clock and R. Roskell on
another. Presumably this was the Robert Roskell
who used the Litherland rack-lever watch escapement.
Joseph Finney also made long-case clocks.
Other makers' names found on Liverpool clocks are
Burges, Aspinall (with the motto, "Time is valuable"),
Jno. Weatherilt. This clock is illustrated (p. <a href="#i_220.jpg">221</a>).
It indicates by the character of its marquetry in the
panel of the door and in the base that it belongs to
the second period of marquetry contemporary with
the influence of Sheraton. In the lunette the
phases of the moon are shown. The date of this is
about 1780 to 1785. Another clock, illustrated on
p. <a href="#i_224.jpg">225</a>, is by Thurston Lassell, Toxteth Park, Liverpool.
This in date is about 1745. The phases of
the moon are shown in the lunette. The case is of
more slender proportions than its fellow. The hood
exhibits a reticence which was lost in later examples,
especially in provincial work made in Yorkshire,
where the case became of unwieldy size and somewhat
ungainly shape.</p>

<p>Other names of Liverpool makers found on long-case
clocks are William Sutton, Harrison &amp; Son,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Jas. Canson, Thomas Saxon, Jo<sup>n</sup> Taylor (Ormskirk),
W. Lassell, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, with motto,
"Time shows the Way of Life's Decay," with brass
face, lunar movement, and monthly dial with indicator.
(This style of dial is a feature of a Shropshire
clock illustrated p. <a href="#i_248a.jpg">249</a>.) Brown, Liverpool, is found
on a mahogany long-case clock and also on a small
long-case clock. To those who are interested the
portrait in oils of Peter Litherland, the inventor of
the rack lever, who died in 1804, is in the possession
of the Corporation of Liverpool.</p>

<p>Among other Lancashire makers the following are
noteworthy: T. Lees (Bury), 1795-1800; Archibald
Coats (Wigan), 1780; Barr (Bolton), 1790; James
Barlow (Oldham), 1775; Benjamin Barlow (Ashton-under-Lyne),
1780; and Nathaniel Brown (Manchester),
1780-1785.</p>

<p>In Westmorland and Cumberland the names
Burton, of Kendal, and Russell, of Carlisle, are
often found on grandfather clocks of local manufacture
of the late eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In regard to a particular style of case associated
with Lancashire and with Cheshire, having the door
decorated with panel in Gothic style, two examples
are illustrated (p. <a href="#i_226.jpg">227</a>), one by Henry Higginbotham
(Macclesfield), and the other by Heywood, Northwich,
1790 (p. <a href="#i_230.jpg">231</a>).</p>

<p><b>Clockmakers of the Midlands.</b>&mdash;As typical of the fine
work produced, the bracket clock by Sam Watson,
of Coventry, 1687, illustrated (p. <a href="#i_180a.jpg">181</a>), shows that the
provincial maker was at that date in no way on a
lower plane than his contemporary in London.
Other makers are Wilson (Warwick), 1709; John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Whitehurst (Derby), 1785&mdash;a fine long-case clock
by this maker is in the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, New York; W. Francis (Birmingham), and
Thomas Wall (Birmingham), 1798. An example
by this maker is illustrated (p. <a href="#i_232.jpg">233</a>), exhibiting a
pastoral scene painted in the lunette of the dial.
This clock&mdash;in the possession of the author&mdash;keeps
excellent time although 120 years old, and has gone
for ten years without stopping.</p>

<p>Of Nottingham makers, the following names of
early craftsmen are found on watches: Isaac Alexander,
about 1760 (a watch, gold inner case, white
dial; outer case of shagreen, with portrait of Charles
Stuart by J. June, 1745), and Thomas Hudson,
about 1790 (silver, white dial; outer case of tortoiseshell,
with silver mounts). The name of Hen.
Page, Upper Broughton (Notts), is found on a brass
clock, and John Kirk was a maker at Epperstone
and Skegby before he came to London in 1677 and
was admitted as a member of the Clockmakers' Company.
Among the collection of watches at Nottingham
Museum, apart from the two above-mentioned,
are a good many by makers of a later date, mainly
of the early nineteenth century: John Lingford,
A. Shepperley, William Young&mdash;all of Nottingham,
and Geo. Stacey, Worksop.</p>

<p>Among the other watches on exhibition are an early
one by Robert Dent (Lincoln), No. 61, and a watch
with gold case with chased <i>repouss√©</i> figures and ornament
by J. Windmills, the celebrated London maker,
1671-1700.</p>

<p>This short list of Midland makers is obviously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
incomplete, and it is to be hoped that some painstaking
horologists will amplify it and do honour to
the makers and to the counties concerned.</p>

<p><b>The Home Counties.</b>&mdash;Thomas Tompion (1671-1713),
the famous London maker, commenced at Bedford
and ended at Bath. We have seen a brass lantern
clock engraved "Thos. Tonkink de Bedforde."
This might very well be one of his early clocks, and
we know his great last triumph in the famous long-case
clock in the Pump Room at Bath. But apart
from this incidental connection of the "father of
English watchmaking" with the provinces, there
stands Joseph Knibb, of Oxon, who was admitted
to the Clockmakers' Company of London in 1677.
He worked in London for the Court of Charles II.
But he was established in Oxfordshire, as is shown
by the copper token he issued, with inscription
"Joseph Knibb Clockmaker in Oxon," and on reverse
the dial of a clock with initials I.K. in centre. We
give an illustration of this token.</p>

<p>A long-case eight-day clock finely decorated in
marquetry, in date about 1690, is illustrated (p. <a href="#i_236.jpg">237</a>).

his employment at the Court shows, to the leading
London makers of his day. In the chapter on

<p>A fine bracket clock by Joseph Knibb, in date
about 1690, is illustrated (p. <a href="#i_180b.jpg">181</a>). This is of the
same period as the long-case clock, the year when
William of Orange defeated James II at the battle
of the Boyne, and James, the last of the Stuarts, fled
into France. It is possible that the fortunes of
Joseph Knibb were bound up with Whitehall. At
the Revolution in 1689 our Court clockmaker no
doubt retreated into Oxfordshire to continue his
creations which we now know. A cloud of unpaid
debts must have hung over him, for the Stuarts were
bad paymasters.</p>

<p>Jacob Lovelace, of Exeter, who died in 1766, was
the maker of a remarkable clock of most elaborate
nature, with organ that played, and a series of
moving figures striking the hours, and bellringers
and other intricate diversions. This clock was exhibited
at the International Exhibition in 1851, and
is now at the Liverpool Museum.</p>

<p>A fine long-case clock in Chippendale style by
Cockey, of Warminster, is illustrated (p. <a href="#i_238.jpg">239</a>), and

<p>Strowbridge, of Dawlish, is the maker of a bracket
clock, in date about 1805, showing pleasing work
in the fine marquetry decoration introduced by
Sheraton (illustrated p. <a href="#i_200b.jpg">201</a>). There is an instance
on record of a clock being sent to "Mr. Strowbridge"
for repair. "When it came back his name, 'H.
Strowbridge, Dawlish,' was engraved upon the dial."</p>

<p><b>Miscellaneous Makers&mdash;East Anglia.</b>&mdash;Several
makers are connected with Yarmouth. There is
Thomas Utting (Yarmouth), and we have seen a fine
long-case clock signed thus, and there is Isaac Johnson
(Yarmouth), who apparently made wall clocks.
John Page, of Ipswich, is the maker of a very handsome
bracket clock, in date about 1740 (illustrated
p. <a href="#i_186a.jpg">187</a>). The name of Henry Terold, Ipswich, is
found on a round silver watch with chased interlacing
bands and silver dial, of seventeenth-century
period. Joseph Chamberlain, of Norwich, is a name
found on a late seventeenth-century watch. The
names of Mann and Jon. Nevill, both of Norwich, are
found on late eighteenth-century grandfather clocks.</p>

<p><b>Kent and Sussex.</b>&mdash;The name of William Gill or
Gilt, of Maidstone, is found on a fine long-case clock
of the eighteenth century. William Gardner, of
Sandwich, and Joseph Carswell, of Hastings, are
other names found on grandfather clocks of the
latter part of the eighteenth century. The dial of a
clock by a Sussex maker, Beeching, of Ashburnham,
from a thirty-hour clock with single hand and alarum
(illustrated p. <a href="#i_242b.jpg">243</a>), is of mid-eighteenth century period,
and shows in its decorations the various phases of
the iron industry carried on at Ashburnham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Welsh Clocks.</b>&mdash;At the Amgueddfa Genedlaethol
Cymru, at Cardiff, the National Museum of the
Principality, there is a long-case clock by B. C.
Vaughan, of Pontypool, and a brass block with movement
by "Shenkyn Shon, Black Cock Inn, Pontnedd
Fechan, 1714," and also there exhibited are the
works of the old clock from St. David's Cathedral.</p>

<p>Illustrated on p. <a href="#i_244.jpg">245</a> is a unique long-case clock with
brass plate on door, with date 1761, with dragon
above. The particular feature of especial interest in
this clock is its oval dial (which is separately
illustrated, p. <a href="#i_248a.jpg">249</a>). This dial is enamelled white,
and has a medallion at top representing the figure
of Hope with an anchor. The other decoration is
interesting as exhibiting the attempt of the provincial
maker to simulate in pigment the marquetry
work of the Sheraton school, the design being similar
to that found on tea-caddies, no doubt well known to
the painter of the dial. There are two subsidiary
dials, one for seconds and the other showing the
days of the month.</p>

<p>Although the maker's name is "Marston (Salop)"
there is an especially Welsh interest attaching to
this clock. It once was in the possession of Daniel
Owen, the famous Welsh novelist, who is buried in
Mold churchyard, and whose monument is in the
County Hall Field at Mold. He introduced this
clock into his novel, <i>Rhys Lewis</i>. The grandmother
of the youthful hero of the story had gone
to the fair; in her absence the boy took this clock
to pieces, so the story goes. But as the hours
wore on he found it was easier to take it to pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
than to put it together again. The scene on the
return of his grandmother is piquantly described.
The clock-work ran like a thing demented, and the
tell-tale hands revealed the secret of the culprit,
who uneasily fingered a missing wheel in his pocket,
and he had forgotten to put on the pendulum.</p>

<p>The hood of the clock is of original decoration.
The upper spandrels have a blue-and-gold floral
design, covered with glass. The two lower spandrels
are delicately carved. The frame around the oval dial
is of beaded work cut in broad and effective style.</p>

<p>Altogether this clock possesses features appealing
to collectors. The provincial maker followed his
own lines, and has in so doing produced something
unique.</p>

<p>In conclusion, some apology should be made for
an attempt to sketch in makers of repute, scattered
over so wide an area, which resulted in a mere outline.
The meagre lists may in many cases be said to be
noteworthy for their omissions. But want of space
has precluded the writer from pursuing the subject
further, and he may be permitted to express a hope
that the perusal of these facts may stimulate local
efforts to worthier records.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<p class="center">SCOTTISH AND IRISH CLOCKS</p>

<p class="chapsum">David Ramsay, Clockmaker Extraordinary to James I&mdash;Some
early "knokmakers"&mdash;List of eighteenth-century
Scottish makers&mdash;Character of Scottish
clocks&mdash;Irish clockmakers: Dublin, Belfast, Cork&mdash;List
of Irish clockmakers.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the most notable of the early Scottish
makers was David Ramsay, who was clockmaker to
James VI of Scotland and followed that monarch
to London. In Sir Walter Scott's <i>Fortunes of
Nigel</i>, Ramsay is introduced as a character. "David
Ramsay by name, who, whether recommended by
his great skill in his profession, as the courtiers
alleged, or, as was murmured among his neighbours,
by his birthplace, in the good town of Dalkeith, near
Edinburgh, held in James's household the post of
maker of watches and horologes to his Majesty.
He scorned not, however, to keep open shop within
Temple Bar, a few yards to the eastward of St.
Dunstan's Church."</p>

<p>It appears that he was of a mystical turn of
mind, and conceived the idea of treasure buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey. Dean
Withnam gave permission to dig, and prudently
stipulated as a condition that he came in for a
share. One John Scott, pretending to the skilled
use of the divining rod, Ramsay, and several others,
according to the astrologer Lilly in his <i>Life and
Times</i>, dug 6 feet deep with the aid of labourers and
came to a coffin, but as it was not heavy they did
not open it, "which we afterwards much repented."
When at this impious task a terrific storm arose,
and "we verily believed the west end of the church
would have fallen upon us." Candles and torches,
except one, were extinguished. "John Scott, my
partner, was amazed, looked pale, knew not what
to think or do until I gave directions and command
to dismiss the demons; which when done, all was
quiet again, and each man returned unto his
lodging late, about twelve o'clock at night." The
share of the Dean in the treasure therefore came to
nought.</p>

<p>The <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> supplements
and corrects Sir Walter. "Clockmaker Extraordinary"
was Ramsay's title, and his son says:
"When James I succeeded to the crown of England,
he sent into France for my father, who was there,
and made him page of the bedchamber and keeper
of his Majesty's clocks and watches."</p>

<p>He was of considerable reputation, as, when the
charter of incorporation was granted by Charles I
to the Clockmakers' Company of London, he was
appointed as the first master in 1631. He apparently
was not of a worldly disposition, and it is believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
that when the destinies of the Stuarts were under a
cloud he was in great poverty. His son writes of
his father: "It's true your carelessness in laying up
while the sun shone for the tempests of a stormy day,
hath given occasion to some inferior spirited people
not to value you for what you are by nature and in
yourself, for such look not to a man longer than he is
in prosperity, esteeming none but for their wealth,
not wisdom, power, nor virtue."</p>

<p>The knowledge of what manner of man was this
old Scottish clockmaker adds a pleasure to the contemplation
of his work. At the Guelph Exhibition
were shown a clock and alarum watch with single
hand, dated 1636, signed <i>D. Ramsay</i>. This was on
the eve of the Civil War, a year before Hampden
refused to pay ship money in England and the introduction
of a new Prayer Book in Scotland. But the
Prayer Book was no sooner opened at St. Giles's,
Edinburgh, than a murmur ran through the congregation,
and the murmur soon grew into a formidable
riot. The Covenant signed in the churchyard of
the Greyfriars at Edinburgh set a flame alight
throughout Scotland. "Such was the zeal of subscribers
that for a while many subscribed with tears
on their cheeks"&mdash;some were indeed reputed to have
"drawn their own blood and used it in place of ink
to underwrite their names."</p>

<p>In such times old David Ramsay, away in the
South, saw Stuart magnificence come to a close. At
the British Museum is a watch he signs "<i>David
Ramsay, Scotus me fecit</i>." In signing thus, he shows
he was proud of being a Scotsman, and as a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Scottish clockmaker his name and record are given
the place of honour at the front of this sketch of
Scottish work. His watches are richly decorated in
the French style; doubtless he learned his craft in
France. His last years were passed in the stormy
period of the Revolution, and he lived to see Cromwell
and the Roundheads defeat Leslie at Dunbar. He
died in Holborn in 1654, the year of the union of
England and Scotland under Cromwell by Ordinance.</p>

<p><b>Some Early "Knokmakers."</b>&mdash;A clock in Scottish is
a <i>knok</i>. It would appear that the early "knokmakers"
were more conversant with the Kirk knok,
the Tolbooth knok, and the College knok, than
with the domestic clock or watch.</p>

<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century, as in
England at a slightly previous date, clockmakers
formed themselves into trade guilds. London was
incorporated in 1631. Edinburgh followed in 1646,
Glasgow, 1649, Haddington, 1753, and Aberdeen
not till 1800. The metal-workers of Scotland have
always been renowned, and at the above dates
clockmakers were eligible to enter the Hammermen's
Incorporations as affiliated with the craft of locksmith,
which was of ancient lineage.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth century the Scottish
clockmakers, in common with English, came under
foreign inspiration. But the eighteenth century saw
a complete school of makers springing up in various
parts of the country, flowing to, and again flowing
from, Edinburgh and the Canongate (including
Leith), which were the earliest centres of Scottish
clockmaking.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>We mention a few of the early makers. There
was Humphry Mills, who is referred to in the minutes
of the Incorporation of Hammermen, Edinburgh, in
1661. There is an example of his work in the Antiquarian
Museum, Edinburgh, and we illustrate another
in the Corporation Museum at Glasgow (p. <a href="#i_258a.jpg">259</a>).
This lantern clock, with brass dial and fine fretwork
with floriated design, is inscribed <i>Humphry Mills at
Edinburgh fecit</i>.</p>

<p>Richard Mills, or Milne, was apparently the nephew
of Humphry, and was admitted a freeman clockmaker
at Edinburgh in 1678. He died in 1710.
Another early maker is John Alexander, of Edinburgh,
made a freeman in 1671, his trial being to
make "ane Knok and mounting and ane sun dyall,"
also a "Kist lock and key," this part of the locksmith's
craft being one of the necessary proofs of
craftsmanship for admission as a fully qualified
Hammerman. He died in 1707. It is interesting
to note that he had to construct a sundial. The art
of dialling is intricate, and this indicates that the old
clockmaker had a sound technical and scientific
knowledge. He was evidently no maker of clocks
as "bits o' mechanism," or an assembler of parts.
He understood principles.</p>

<p>Thomas Gordon, apprentice to Andrew Brown,
Edinburgh, 1688, was in business for forty years and
died in 1743. His nephew, Patrick Gordon, was the
son of Alexander Gordon, of Briggs, and seems to
have been a man of wealth, apart from his trade
as a clockmaker. A fine example of his work is
illustrated (p. <a href="#i_262.jpg">263</a>), a long-case clock having the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
of lacquered work in the "Chinese taste." On the
case without the panel is stencilled work, attempting
to follow out the style of the imported panel. This
example indicates what has already been advanced
in the chapter on Lacquered Cases (pp. <a href="#Page_110">110</a>, <a href="#Page_114">114</a>),
that such work was of foreign origin. This panelled
door is of oak.</p>

<p>Other seventeenth-century makers include Paul
Roumieu, 1677 to 1694, the first practical watchmaker
who came to Edinburgh. Before that date
only clocks were attempted.</p>

<p>Paul Roumieu, jun., son of the above, was admitted
as a freeman of Edinburgh in 1692, and died in
1710.</p>

<p><b>List of Eighteenth-century Scottish Makers.</b>&mdash;In
regard to the activities of Scottish clockmakers in
comparison with their fellow-craftsmen across the
border, it is interesting to note that there are very
few examples of the early crown and verge escapement
by Scotch makers, but there are a great number
of the anchor escapement. Although invented by
Hooke in 1675, this was not taken up readily. This
unwillingness to adopt new styles is a feature in
clockmaking in the provinces and in Scotland. The
works of a clock are not unfrequently put by the
maker into a case belonging to a period of cabinet
work of some forty years previous. The clockmaker
was an autocrat, and compelled the case-maker to
follow old traditions in making cases.</p>

<p>The writer desires to record his indebtedness to
the useful <i>Handbook and Directory of Old Scottish
Clockmakers from 1540 to 1850</i>, by John Smith, Esq.,
published by William J. Hay, Esq., John Knox's
House, Edinburgh, 1903. This volume is now out
of print, and a new and enlarged edition containing
no less than 2,700 names is shortly appearing. No
student or collector of Scottish clocks can afford to
be without this volume, as it is the only one dealing
with its subject.</p>

<p>In regard to districts in England and Wales, there
is an opportunity for local antiquarian societies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
gather and tabulate county lists on the lines of this
Scottish volume. The records of provincial makers
are still exasperatingly incomplete.</p>

<p>There is the authoritative volume by the late
F. J. Britten, <i>Old Clocks and Watches and their
Makers</i>, with a list of over 10,000 names. But in
the main these are of London makers.</p>

<p><b>Character of Scottish Clocks.</b>&mdash;It is seldom that a
clock by a Scottish maker is found to be cased in
old oak. Most of the long-case clocks are of
mahogany, which was not in general use till about
1740. It is true that there are exceptions, some few
being found in lacquered or Dutch marquetry cases,
but the majority are in mahogany.</p>

<p>In regard to clockmaking on a lower plane, there
are the interesting clocks, with the works entirely
constructed of wood, usually beech, as being the best
wood adapted to cutting the teeth for the wheels;
other woods used were holly and boxwood. Very
few old examples now remain.</p>

<p>There seems, too, to have been a strong proclivity
towards the musical clock. Several great makers
produced fine examples of this class of clock which
played popular airs. No doubt in the days of
musical boxes, prior to the age of the gramophone,
the great folk at Edinburgh, when the "Wizard of
the North" enchanted society, had a penchant for
these musical sweet-chiming clocks. Daniel Brown,
of Mauchline, made the modest clock that stood in
the cottage of Robert Burns; and James Gray, or
John Smith, or Patrick Toshach, or one of the other
clockmakers who made the hours "fading in music,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
may have constructed some musical marvel for the
master of Abbotsford.</p>

</div>

<p>An interesting clock with the maker's name,
Jos. Gibson, Ecclefechan, is illustrated (p. <a href="#i_266a.jpg">267</a>). It
has a long pendulum and single weight for striking
and going trains. The spandrels are finely cut and
chased and represent the four seasons. This is a
feature found on Dutch dials. In date this is about
1750. The enlargement of the dial (p. <a href="#i_266b.jpg">267</a>) shows
that the engraver went wrong in his spacing. He
had to put the last letter above the others. Indeed,
it suggests that another hand than that which engraved
the decoration and the name of the maker
contributed the place. It is somewhat puzzling, and
leads to conjecture as to its history. It is just such
examples, out of the main stream of leading makers,
which so often provide exceptional interest to the
collector.</p>

<p><b>Irish Clockmakers.</b>&mdash;The art of the clockmaker
in Ireland, although having by no means lagged
behind that of Scotland, has not received the
attention of collectors and connoisseurs which it
deserves.</p>

<p>Researches are being made, and new data are
coming to hand which will assist the student to
determine the period of Irish clockmakers' work.
There are some 1,100 names already known of
makers, and those interested await the results of
close and painstaking investigation which will enable
the record to be published.</p>

<p>By the kindness of Mr. Dudley Westropp, of the
National Museum, Dublin, the following names are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
here given, tabulating a few of the leading Irish
makers of the eighteenth century:&mdash;</p>

  <li>Edward Tounley (Dundalk), 1820-24.</li>
  <li>Richard Wyatt (Dublin), 1731-55 (died).</li>
</ul>

<p>These dates do not represent the makers' complete
history. Some may have worked prior to the first
date and after the last date, except when stated as
having died then.</p>

<p>In regard to Belfast, the late Isaac W. Ward contributed
some notes to the <i>Belfast Evening Telegraph</i>
in 1909 on "Early Belfast Clock and Watchmakers,"
which enable some interesting particulars to be given.
In 1791 one Job Rider announced that he had commenced
business in Belfast, "where he makes clocks
and watches of all kinds in the common manner with
Harrison's and other modern improvements." It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
would appear that he had been to London, where
possibly he was apprenticed, and had visited Dublin
and Hillsborough. From 1805 to 1807 he was in
partnership with R. L. Gardner. After 1807 he
seems to have been associated with William Boyd.</p>

<p>Robert Neill, who was apprenticed to Job Rider in
1791, set up business in Belfast in 1803 and joined
R. L. Gardner from 1809 to 1818. At this date the
firm became known as Robert Neill &amp; Sons. Robert
Neill died in 1857. His descendants still carry on
business at Belfast. Another Belfast maker was
James Wilson, who worked in the middle of the
eighteenth century. There is a record of a musical
clock being advertised by him in 1755, which he had
constructed to play a number of tunes.</p>

<p>The wall clock by George Graydon, of Dublin
(illustrated p. <a href="#i_268.jpg">269</a>), shows some interesting features.
The circle round the dial is carved wood gilt; the
dial itself is painted and very much cracked. The
lower part is harewood inlaid. In date this example
is about 1796, as it will be seen the volunteer in
uniform on panel has G.R. on his cartouche-box.</p>

<p>The bracket clock by George Aicken, of Cork
(illustrated p. <a href="#i_272.jpg">273</a>), is of fine proportions and sound
design. It has striking and chiming movements,
and plays six tunes marked on lunette, "Minuet,
March, Jigg, Air, Minuet, Gavot."</p>

<p>An early nineteenth century clock by Sharp, of
Dublin, is illustrated (p. <a href="#i_274.jpg">275</a>). It is a miniature
long-case clock, being only 3 feet 5&frac12; inches high.
It is made to hang on the wall, as there are two
rings at the back of the case for this purpose. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
glass door, showing the pendulum, indicates the
French influence, which in the early nineteenth
century made itself felt in Ireland as elsewhere.</p>

<p>In 1783 a company of Swiss watchmakers came
to Ireland, and establishing themselves near Waterford,
termed their settlement New Geneva. By
23 &amp; 24 George III, 1784, they were granted
power to assay gold and silver. An earlier Act
of George II provided for only one standard of
gold&mdash;22 carats. This new Act admitted three&mdash;22,
20, and 18 carats. These facilities were granted
to encourage the manufacture of watches and watch-cases
in Ireland. This Assay Office at New Geneva
did not continue in operation more than six years.</p>

<p>The office at New Geneva had equal powers
with the Dublin Assay Office. "The Assayer or
Wardens are hereby required to make, on a plate
of pewter or copper, impressions of such marks or
punches, with the names and places of abode of
the owner thereof, in a book or books to be
carefully kept for that purpose, if such owners be
resident at Dublin or New Geneva." Watches or
other articles of gold and silver having the stamp
"New Geneva" are in date 1784 to 1790.</p>

<p class="center">A FEW NOTES ON WATCHES</p>

<p class="chapsum">The age of Elizabeth&mdash;Early Stuart watches&mdash;Cromwellian
period&mdash;Watches of the Restoration&mdash;The William and Mary
watch&mdash;Eighteenth-century watches&mdash;Pinchbeck and the toy
period&mdash;Battersea enamel and shagreen.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> makers of English watches do not crowd
the stage. On the Continent pocket clocks had
had a long life before they made their appearance
in this country. Queen Elizabeth had only one
pair of silk stockings&mdash;she had been used to "cloth
hose"&mdash;before her lady-in-waiting presented her with
a pair straight from the Continent. Italian and
French ideas were fast acclimatizing themselves
here. Shakespeare laid many of his plays in
Italy; the modern Elizabethan Englishman became
quite Italian; the Queen read Tasso and Ariosto
in the originals. In Germany the watch had taken
various forms. The watchmakers of Nuremberg
were renowned throughout Europe. "Nuremberg
eggs," as they were styled, set the fashion for
watches of all shapes suited to the conceits of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
owner. Some were in the form of a skull, with
appropriate mottoes concerning Time and Death;
others were in the form of a cross, of a book, or
shaped like a tulip or other flowers, or simulating
butterflies and insects. The earliest styles had
closed cases, these cases being subjected to various
forms of ornament. The dial was not visible till
the outer case was opened.</p>

<p>Collectors of watches are collecting something
that is dead. The wheels are silent for ever. The
interest lies in the remoteness of the conception
of a pocket clock. Possibly there is no one alive
who could now set the wheels into motion, as
there are no designers who could originate the
exquisite tracery and filigree work, the perfect
enamelling and the delicacy of metal work these
old watches exhibit.</p>

<p>They belong to a world apart. Clocks of old
masters still carry on their functions: the hand
still revolves in unison with the slow swing of
the "royal pendulum." As timekeepers they equal
most of the modern, and excel the cheap clock,
hardly worth designating as a timekeeper. But
the Swiss and the American factory-made watch,
claiming no equality of artistic embellishment, have
dethroned the antique watch in regard to accuracy.
Curious and rare examples of the latter crowd the
shelves of museums as being representative of that
mysterious past when Time was of less moment than
it is now. They belong to the age of the missal
and the illuminated manuscript, and of the advent of
printing with Caxton's well-balanced page. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
are at variance with modernity. They were
machines before the age of machinery&mdash;their very
mechanism protests against being regarded as
scientifically accurate. One lingers over their
ornament with loving regard and forgets their
purport. As timekeepers they fell short of the
abbey clock, or of the sundial&mdash;a perennial stickler
for truth when the sun shone. When the long pendulum,
under the auspices of Christopher Huygens,
commenced swinging, a timekeeper ready to hand
eclipsed their gold and enamelled triumphs. But
as fashionable baubles they had their continuous
evolution, from Thomas Chamberlaine de Chelmisforde
to Pinchbeck, and from Tompion to Eardley
Norton. A considerable amount of ingenuity was
given to producing examples of diminutive size
which should perform adequately the correct functions
of a timekeeper. But accuracy and scientific
exactitude came late in the story of evolution.
At length man's ingenuity triumphed. There are
watches no larger than filberts which keep exact
time, but there are thousands which do not.</p>

<p>The last popular watch, which our grandfathers
termed a "turnip," was the stage prior to modern
development, and at that stage collecting ends.</p>

<p>A scientific classification of watches would
resolve itself under the following heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>Early watches</i>, prior to the invention and
general adoption of the fusee, that is, from about
1500 to 1540. This period would be further subdivided
into (<i>a</i>) those with movements entirely of
steel; (<i>b</i>) the next stage, with plates and pinions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
brass and the wheels and pinions of steel; and the
latest stage, (<i>c</i>), in which the plates and wheels
were brass and the pinions of steel, as at the
present day.</p>

<p>II. <i>Watches from about 1540 to 1640</i>, all having
fusees, and being made of every conceivable shape
and size: octagonal, oval, cruciform, in the shape
of a book, and so on. The cases were sometimes
of crystal or bloodstone, and enamelled designs
and chased gold work were predominant features.</p>

<p>III. <i>Watches of the seventeenth century</i>, from 1610
to 1675, at which date the pendulum spring was
invented. These are mainly round in shape,
according to the fashion about 1620, which superseded
the ancient quaint forms. The cases, both
of silver and gold, were richly enamelled, and
moving calendars and astronomical details were
frequently made.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Late seventeenth and early eighteenth century
watches.</i> These would embrace the period from
1675 to 1720, after the invention of the pendulum
spring.</p>

<p>V. <i>The eighteenth century watch.</i> This should
include all the improvements, changes in decorative
style, and other details bringing the watch up to the
threshold of the nineteenth century and modernity.</p>

<p>We can only indicate the type of watch as falling
under the various periods, and specimens of
the leading types are illustrated (pp. <a href="#i_282.jpg">283</a>, <a href="#i_286.jpg">287</a>).</p>

<p>The watches are numbered in the illustrations from
one to ten, and can thus be easily identified by the
reader.</p>

<p><i>No. 1</i> shows the character of an Elizabethan
watch. The fine case shows the quality of the
chased and repouss√© open-work design.</p>

<p><i>No. 2</i> is a James I oval watch, and the maker is
Yate, of London. This watch is dated 1620, in the
reign of James I, the year when the <i>Mayflower</i>
sailed to America and New England was founded
by those wise Puritans who foresaw the oncoming
civil war of the next reign. The Earl of Ashburnham
exhibited at the Stuart Exhibition in 1889 a
gold watch which formerly belonged to Charles I,
inscribed "Henricus Jones, Londini." Another
maker of watches of this period is Edward East.
The silver alarum clock given by Charles I on his way
to execution to Thomas Herbert was made by Edward
East. "Through the garden the King passed into
the park, where making a stand, he asked Mr.
Herbert the hour of the day: and taking the clock
into his hand, gave it him, and bade him keep it in
memory of him." This silver alarum watch is still
treasured in the Mitford family.</p>

<p><i>No. 3</i> is a Cromwellian silver watch, plum-shaped.
As coats of arms were not so sinful as painted
cherubs and stained-glass windows, this bauble with
elaborately engraved crest survived the wreckers'
despoiling hand. Cromwell himself boasted of a
crest, and in some respects it resembled that used
by royalty.</p>

<p><i>No. 4</i> is a Restoration watch made by Snow, of
Lavington, near Bath. It exhibits fine ornamentation
and is a beautiful specimen of Late Stuart style
when sumptuousness, under the guiding influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
of the French Louis Quatorze grandeur, made
itself felt in this country.</p>

<p><i>No. 5</i> is worthy of respect and admiration as being
the work of that great maker, Thomas Tompion.
It is of the William and Mary period. The craftsman
had arrived at the period of a scientific endeavour
to create a perfect timekeeper. The case
indicates utility; ornament is in due subjection.
The Arabic figures showing the seconds on the
dial should be observed.</p>

<p><i>No. 6</i>, of which the back is shown, is a watch
by Peter Garon. It is in black piqu√© case, finely
decorated in a subdued and reticent manner. Peter
Garon flourished between 1694 and 1706. But in
that year, when Marlborough's campaigns were at
their full height, poor Garon felt the stress of
commercial depression and became bankrupt.</p>

<p><i>No. 7</i>, showing the front and open case, is a fine
watch by Duhamel, about 1740, bringing us to the
days of George I and Walpole.</p>

<p><i>No. 8</i>, with its fine broad repouss√© case, is by
Haydon, and the case is signed "V. Haut."</p>

<p><i>No. 9</i> shows an illustration of the back, where the
movement is visible. The maker of this is Daniels,
of Leighton, 1760.</p>

<p><i>No. 10</i> is by Kemp, London, and is decorated
in Battersea enamel and shagreen. This brings
us to the age of Pinchbeck, "the toyman in the
Strand," and suggests the gewgaws and trifles,
the enamelled heads for malacca canes, the snuff-boxes,
and all the fashionable paraphernalia of a
man about town. The watch in some respects had
begun to lose its old character and was again
a toy.</p>

<p>Among interesting work is that of Thomas
Chamberlaine de Chelmisforde. He worked in the
brightest days of Charles I, when the arts were
receiving stimulation from the Court. A new era
seemed as though it might be about to dawn. The
picture gallery of Charles I at Hampton Court
showed his catholic taste, and his Queen, Henrietta
Maria, was a patron of the arts. Vandyck and other
great artists flocked to this country, and highly
trained craftsmen commenced to build a reputation
which later iconoclasts swept aside as of Baal.</p>

<p>In the watch illustrated by Thomas Chamberlaine
there is something delightfully simple and chaste.
He was a maker whose work promised much. There
is a specimen of his work signed "Chamberlain
Chelmisford" at the British Museum, but in the
specimen illustrated the name is chased "Thomas
Chamberlaine de Chelmisforde."</p>

<p>The study of watches of the various periods is a
fascinating one. When the collector leaves the path
of clocks, with their more Gargantuan proportions,
to become a student of the intricacies of the art
of the watchmaker as exemplified in some of his
greatest triumphs, he has been enticed on a quest
which is unending. No field in collecting and
connoisseurship has claimed more devotees.</p>

<p>"Complementary to the useful companion volume, in this 'Chats'
Series, on English China which Mr. Hayden issued five years
ago."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>"Is a compendious account of our native English fa√Øence,
abundantly illustrated and accurately written."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"A thoroughly trustworthy working handbook."&mdash;<i>Truth.</i></p>

<p>"It is a mine of knowledge, gathered from all quarters, and the
outcome of personal experience and research, and it is written with
no little charm of style."&mdash;<i>Lady's Pictorial.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Hayden knows and writes exactly what is needed to help
the amateur to become an intelligent collector, while his painstaking
care in verifying facts renders his work a stable book of
reference."&mdash;<i>Connoisseur.</i></p>

<p>"The volume has been written as a companion to Mr. Hayden's
'Chats on English China' in the same series, and those who recall
the admirable character of that book will find this to be in no way
inferior."&mdash;<i>Nation.</i></p>

<p>"The illustrations are profuse and excellent, and the author and
the publishers must be commended for offering us so many reproductions
of typical specimens that have not appeared in any
previous handbook. The illustrations alone are worth the cost of the
book."&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Hayden's book is filled to overflowing with beautiful and
most instructive and helpful illustrations, and altogether it is one
that will give immense pleasure to collectors, and much information
